"get on the scale, elmore."

didn't care 4 this song as much as the other 1. not a big slide guitar fan.
you want me to just dislike it so i don't break your two year streak?
"okay, in going to go back to reading this depressing richard yates book."
this is the only courtney barnett song i've heard:
the song i heard is called nobody really cares if you don't go to the party. #courtneybarnett

she sounds a lot like liz phair.
"i only heard the song todd-o-phonic todd played on his last show, but it was very impressive."
listening to courtney barnett for the first time. wow!
listening to light leaks. wonderful! 🎶👍
"i have a sticker, but it's too small and won't completely cover the stain. will a post-it note work?"
"right on! thanks, tim. i'll do that. 👍"
"no! i picked it up, looked at it, tried to remember if i'd worn it, smelled it, asked my wife if i wore it. she didn't know."
"wore a shirt to work i found on the bedroom floor. just noticed it's stained. should've known it was dirty. i mean, i found it on the floor."
when i was 13yo i got a summer job working in a library. they put me in the basement &amp; had me make sure the books were in order. it sucked.
good! i can't be bothered. i'm working 50 hours a week &amp; writing a book. all i want is to know when my floss is about to run out!
if the dental floss folks can't color the floss maybe they could put a small transparent window in front of the spool area on the container.
"why don't the folks who make dental floss make the last few feet near the spool a different color, so you know when you're about to run out?"
good morning.
these are great!

just made a vine of the contact lens stuck behind my eyeball reappearing and my subsequent extraction of it. won't share it. it's too gross!
rt i was trying to copy/paste an image into illustrator but somehow pasted #italianlobsterman :(
"rt ugh, neighbor, why did you bring your pants outside and then put them on?"
"more than anything, it's gross."
it's not that bad when it happens. i've put a new 1 in on top of the lost &amp; have taken it out multiple x b4 the lost one reappears.
yep! now i have to wait until it creeps into the front of my eyeball in the middle of the night and wakes me up.
yes! a caller asked chelsea about max being absent and chelsea complained about nev's name being pronounced neeve.
"yeah, i just lost a contact lens behind my eyeball. why?"

do you think there'll be a tribute to that wrestler who died in the ring a couple weekends ago?
"just looked it up. wrestlemania is $60 ppv b4 fees etc and might be more in hd. heck, if you have 12 pals, that's only $5 apiece!"
i love the idea of a bunch of friends chipping in to rent wrestlemania and congregating at one house and making a party of it.
how much i$ it?
"that's awesome, man. i saw a house jam-packed with cars on my way home from my mom's. i have to assume it's a wrestlemania party."
not bad. visited a friend yesterday &amp; did some reading. visited my mom today &amp; i'm taking my kid shopping for headphones l8r. &amp;u?
wow! she certainly is!
"rt holy diver, you've been down to long in the midnight sea..."
rt this is how i feel most mornings when i wake up.

"rt if you ask me, there's nothing ""un-smart"" about saying ""hello!"" and introducing yourself to a new friend. but hey, i'm no sc…"
"okay. i can't spring $300 for beats, but i figure i can find something that sounds good &amp; will last her more than a month. thx"
"right on! thank you so much, john. i've had a sony hphones i bought 15+ years ago. wasn't sure if sony's stuff was still good."
rt these still exist ....i wonder if anyone under the age of 18 knows how to operate
"taking my 13yo daughter shopping for headphones. can anyone recommend a durable, inexpensive brand?"
tori amos' boys for pele would definitely fall somewhere in my top 25 favorite albums of the 1990s.
okay. please let me know when you're done at the record fair what you've purchased (if anything).
"is $22 for that beach boys album considered fair, mike? i don't even know."
"that's so great, man. i remember my daughter asked me, when she was about 4 or 5, ""why the couch?"" it still makes me smile."
"hug your kids, dingus."
ouch! i try not to spend more than $10 on used vinyl.

now i have to go to rc's profile to see a pic of this dumb hat. thanks!
i'm sorry i didn't remember that one. the one call of yours i've never forgotten is with you &amp; andy &amp; the abandoned house.
"rt during one of my earliest calls, i suggested he interview steve marriott. (yes, i knew he was dead.) tom …"
must be coincidence. was steve marriott mentioned in a best show bit?
"steve marriott's dead, dave."
did you ask him if he ever saw humble pie back in the day?
i think we smoked cigarettes under the bleachers one time in '86.
2010 was a good year for music.

do you like apples?
will she answer a direct question?
"oh my god, shannon! is ariel good at keeping dante busy so he doesn't drive you crazy?"
hahaha! i'm guessing she's changed her gym schedule after two weekends in a row getting off a machine &amp; seeing me waving.
looking at them now. standby!
hahaha! i loved when i told you she put a lock on my locker in order to steal my sweaty gym clothes.
"did you say, ""that's neither here nora there.""?"
how's dante been?
"no shit, right!? i didn't want to get out of bed. i didn't leave the house until after 2pm to go to the y. didn't see ab."
how's your sanity? it must be nice to get out of the house after working in it all week.
i've gone to the mb near the hudson facility on my break and just stood at the free coffee machine &amp; drank java for 15min.☕️
"yeah, i've been. it's bittersweet because at most mbs they have free coffee and they don't at exit 8 because of the cafe. 😢"
"oh cool! they have a cafe at that one, right?"
juli went to the mb on dw with her friend joanne. which one were you at?
we always play injustice. it's basically superheroes beating the snot out of each other. where did you go shopping?
not too bad. went to a pal's house to play video games with him and his son. watching louie right now with juli.

"very true, ill just have to keep playing, at this rate i'll most probably be 70!"
if i could afford the 60k for one i'd be ecstatic!

"a new model come out, the new focus is a great looking car."
i actually quite like the focus too! 😂 they've always been vauxhall's biggest rival and i think they pip them every time...
"i had so many customers that wouldn't deal because of the lack of bt, vauxhall really need to sort that on the next gen!"
i used to love my h. the j is a nice looking motor and a vast improvement over the h appearance &amp; styling wise though!
how do you find the j compared to the h?
"that's another thing too, it would have to be the 190bhp juke dig-t engine 👌 power unit indeed. i was gonna ask"
"beemer is a cracking car, just want something taller and the bigger bm's don't appeal to me. i want to stay finance free too."
"nissan juke, i fancy something taller, but i've never driven one so its more of a fact finding that a buying trip haha."
👍 good to hear. i was going to go today while i'm off but will have to wait till next weekend 😂
sounds good. just never had any experience from their so didn't fancy getting bad service.
has anyone had any experience of buying a car from motorpoint?? 🚗
so damn true! 🙈
just think the juke looks mean. especially in red or black!
ohh a qashaqai 😂 erm they're nice but the juke is nicer styled in my opinion
excuse me?
"they're mega money, and i refuse to pay extortionate amounts for insurance!"
i've even looked at the dacia duster!
i just want a 4x4 😭
oh god no. that's just put me off 😕 is it really too mumsy?
i love the wheels too! haha i'm getting old i must be because this really appeals to me!

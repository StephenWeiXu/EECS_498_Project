rt *replaces feelings with weed*
i recorded evelyn freaking out at herself in the forward facing cam. 😂
that pei wei was prime 👌
i'm getting pei wei today. no if ands or buts about it.
really thinking of taking evelyn outta her crib so i have someone to hug.
guess i'm not getting the only thing i've been wanting for like a week now. #grumpyaus
if i could redo my life i would do so many things differently and i'd be such a better person.
i'm so over this. things will never be how they should.
i have no idea what i did that made life be like fuck it everything you don't want here have it.
forever unsatisfied.
so funny how quickly people go back to doing things they say they're stopping.
okay downpour from nowhere.
i'm a lot funnier when i'm alone.
blah.
dinner date with my loves. ☺️👨👸👶
every time i take off the blanket the ac kicks on and i'm like fuuuuuuhhhhhhck
and she's super excited. which makes me even happier.
going to college is going to be the best experience. i'm so happy for and jealous of my cousin!
such a stressful day. i need a beer.
i've had enchiladas three times this week. no complaints here.
eevee has a toy that plays melodies that sound like they should be in a pokemon game. 😍
upside i got evelyn to sleep in her crib. downside i have to also be in the crib.
and cold. ❄️
ugh. i needa clean and shower and i'm hungry af and tired af. ugh.
😍
man if she was better with other people yeah. but with people other than my mom she's only good for like an hour.
omg that lesbian couple at six flags was so awesome. i miss them. haha
that was the best beach trip ever. best day ever. hands down. ever since that day i knew. i just knew.
idk... the vibes from our last beach trip are hard to beat.
never thought i acted/talked like carlos until i was hanging out with my cousin today. 👀 oh no.
""
six flags with my cousin! ☺️🙌❤️
hell yes. which means more fests!
🙌 woohoo!
one day i'll have my bed back. until then i have two bed hogs.
🐘
now that i see the pic it makes sense.
i was under the impression it was a nude. i'm sorry.
not trying to cause bs that shouldn't happen to anyone without consent but can't be upset bc you were underage if you posted it to
and she sayin she was underage... why'd you post it on twitter then...? yes that person was wrong but she still posted it first.
rt can't wait for oitnb
yes that'd be great.
getting easier and better everyday.
of course dinner is ready and the only way evie won't scream rn is if i'm cradling her. of course.
sounds perfect. i miss our kandi seshs and stuff
true. my mom watches her about once a month so that's nice.
that makes it hard. i think it's because we look alike.
me too. i also wish evelyn liked being baby say by anyone other than my mom.
well you can... just not skip shows to do so.
that's what we thought too.
honestly wish evelyn came a year later. i would have gotten at least a year to be 18. i didn't get to be a young adult for long.
enjoy being a kid first. baby sitters are harder to find than people think. you don't get to fuck around a lot once a parent.
"it's done! i sent one, okayyyyy? lol"
i'm sorry 😭
"i don't think everything i do is the right thing, but i'm an addict and selfish and have to do things for me once in a while."
don't feel like wearing a shirt anymore.
i feel like we haven't had this good of a home cooked dinner recently.
super fresh and clean. so freaking great.
"cajun grilled shrimp and tilapia with steamed rice, salad, and rolls. yummm 😋🍴"
carlos needs to cook already. 😡
that makes twice today.... i think we're winning here!
"carlos and i basically have a ""rave"" lost and found of all the stuff people have left here after a show."
meee too. it's been too long since i've seen the fam.
fuck these intersections.
no way i'm missing that! already have baby sitters lined up!
thinking about our wildstylez cuddle sesh. miss you. ❤️
yay chinese.
oh my lord this is taking for ever.
evie is trippin out on fantasia.
i figured the pearl or the quarry would have one. i'm gonna look into it.
my aunts comin to town and we wanna take her out!
any know of any good vegetarian restaurants in san antonio? 😳
i can't wait.
11 mo to be exact
she'll be about a year.
that'd be super dope.
lol i'm not jealous! i like other babies too!
rt elephant sketch 🐘💕✏️
people really think calling me a bitch is going to hurt me. lol. i know i'm a bitch. i don't care.
"i live in a biggish city, i'd walk an hour to my best friends house every night and 2 mi to my exes every morning."
yes! it's so nice out. and you exercise! i think that was the only way i stayed in shape 2/3 summers ago 😅
i don't even know how many times i walked home drunk as shit bc i wasn't gonna let someone drive me. i always enjoyed it.
and not surround yourself with those kinds of people. sorrynotsorry
i feel like 💩.
rt i thought we had like 4 rice krispie bars left and u know what we got? fuckin zero. i don't even wanna get up in the morning …
thats all the way
people endanger others and don't even care about it.
i haaaate when people think it's okay to drink and drive. the only thing i can do is not be one of those people too.
i missed that voice. you'll be home before i know it.
evelyn is only wanting to sleep in my arms rn.
rt fucking family dude
this is the longest we've been apart since we started dating. #lame
one more day.
haha thank you!
i can't wait for more play dates. evelyn and jane are quite the pair.
eevee should wake up so mama can clean noisily.
the joys of sick children.
what's the record for biggest snot bubble? evelyn's coming up on two inches...
just breathe.
rt
ugh. i don't even want food anymore. whhhhy
in definite need of goodvibes.
i should not be driving today. too many retards not enough patients.
not sorry about it. you're a manager at mcdonalds and you wanna call me trash. okay. 😂
it's simple. in a drive through you don't tell a car to fucking reverse when there's more behind it.
fucking cunt at mcdonalds causes some dumbass to back into me and when i'm upset they have the nerve to call me trash okay you work at mcd
so fucking drained.
these every hour wake ups are killing me.
so much for a relaxing weekend. 😅
still not sure if worth it. well it's evelyn so it is but c'mon it should be free.
for real such a waste of money and time. but at least i know it's not something worse.
time to snuggle my sicky nuggles.
rocked my toms today. gosh i miss wearing them.
when you blow your nose and it goes right past the tissue and into your palm. and it was a big one too. 😔😷
people that steal from their own family are the worst kinds of people. they have no limits.
just another day when you should be here and aren't.
if i can get my tan on then i'd totally get a triangl bikini. buuuut until then i have to stick with lame.
my mom just said she would've watched evelyn so i could go to buku.... kinda too late mom. plus driving wouldn't have worked.
spring breakers are the reason i hate spring break. nothing but ratchet trashy people.
calvin harris' blame is on kidz bop 28.... let that sink in.
real fuckin pissed rn.
evelyn's cry is funny bc she's congested. my poor sick girl.
ali carlos has your bassnectar mask... so you can finally get it. 😅
i wanna be there with you guys. 😭
too jelly.
don't offer your help if you're not gonna pull through when someone needs you.
i only need help with one thing and when you say you'll help i expect you to respond the day of
too bad just being a cute girl with a professional camera doesn't count!
hopefully i can get her back down so i can at least enjoy a few more hours of sleep.
just want my baby girl to feel better.
is 830 too early for bed? i'm exhausted.
idk how i clean all the time and my apartment is still a wreck.
oh well there's wine and beer in the fridge. no complaints there.
excited but also sad to be alone. i bet if i felt better this would be more fun.
hate blowing my nose so hard my ears pop.
so tired of people screaming in my face.
we got a cowboy showing on up to the park.
no on wears their fuck me panties to bed to be woken up with out sex.
have no idea what i'm going to do this weekend. i'm not staying in this apartment alone the whole time that's for sure.
if the ghost turns on the dryer buzzer one more time. i think i'm going to die.
evelyn was watching tv and a diamond ring was on the screen and she started oohing like crazy. baby girl knows. 👸👑💍💎💖
my tongue hates me for all the hot and acidicy things i have ate today.
and this cough can gtfo
duuuude i've felt like shit for almost a whole week now.
there's only a few things i miss about breast feeding. mainly my huge tits.
alright deal.
i would but 21 is two years away 😭
i'm jelly.
👌😂
at first i read corsets. damn you for getting my hopes up dylan!
😍
not to mention i have a killer headache.
rn the only way to get evelyn calmed is pulling my hair. things i do for her.
i keep getting great pictures of evelyn today.
my aunt will be here a week from today! holy 🐮 i miss her.
mmmm strawberries and walnuts for my snack!
napping with evelyn is the best.
salt and vinegar chips rock my world.
on top of everything i have to do today i also have four loads of laundry that need to be washed and i'm just bleh.
never letting food cool before eating will be the death of my mouth and taste buds.
some people are ridiculous. have a baby by mistake sure but don't have more when you're still not ready and stable. at least i know that.
hate having to wake up my princess.
"""do you want a beer?"" ""yes, and a blanket."""
a tax receipt.
"carlos is working from home and all i hear is, ""suck my dick nigga tit"""
plus you're oranger than an oompa loompa.
i see some girl that seriously need to lay off the spray tan. it's been cloudy and rainy af since november. we know it's not real.
i really regret not taking maternity photos. 😔
forgetting where you parked and proceeding to walk around the complex like a retard.
bitch about me breaking a mirror at least i didn't break your favorite things like you did mine.
and i really wanna smoke so mentally i won't be so hung up on being sick but that's gonna make me feel worse physically.
i can't get my body temp comfortable. i go from freezing to sweating like every 10 min.
plus it's pouring and i don't wanna have to take my love out
ugh. and i have to give my dad the car today. can i please just have a hot shower jammies and cartoons with evie and not go anywhere.
i feel like the mom from that dayquil commercial. bc moms don't take sick days.
i don't feel good at all. the house is still a wreck and i need to clean but all i wanna do is sleep.
carlos wants my ass fat but won't give me more cookies.
my lunch was so good. 😍
like i give her her lully then i look and she has her keys
evelyn keeps pulling toys out of nowhere. where is she finding these?
never again.
evelyn is four months old today. holy cow.
some people have no business owning an animal
and it wasn't even my rave day.
cleaning up after rave day sucks.
again carlos is sleeping with his eyes open. #creepyaf
praying i feel better tomorrow.
can't wait for a trip up there.
evelyn really likes dogs. everyday she shows more and more interest in them.
as are you my love!
saw on insta but 😍😍
"""she's a bitch, and she doesn't have a booty."" ""are you saying even though i'm a bitch at least i have a booty?"" ""yeah"""
so glad i finally got to meet my boo 😘 can't wait to catch a set together soon.
sorry i'm sick and need your help today. 😅
i just found a full water bottle under the couch. what happened last night?! 😅
at least carlos is getting me chickfila tortilla soup to help me feel better.
i love them too! especially babies.
my mom keeps telling me i can watch tv. really mom? can i? thank you so much!
thank you!! ☺️
lol i've been boobs for almost two years now.

my 70'dodge challenger was plum crazy but it was a hemi with posi rear end and a pistol grip 4 speed it was a trip to drive &amp;openup
i believe it was called the thunderbolt it was the meanest car on the road and track and this one looks like it could do the job
but this car is absolutely gorgeous and restored to all its glory
beautiful throwback ford fairlane i can't remember the name of this ford i believe its called thunder ?something can someone help
i'd love to have one for my wife of 48 years that would make her so very happy
you won't know you were hit until its too late
and 3 two barrel carburetors you could smoke the tires a city block
the 67' gto was the most beautifully designed of them all with the three slit tail lights and the 421ci engine
the dodge dart with the 440cu. was mean and easy to handle and tied with a 4 speed pistol grip shifter you could fly
thats when the chevy camero became a true muscle car that ss 396 changed everything
"that's the most beautiful ford galaxie they ever made, sweet as honey"
"happy birthday j - si may you have many, many more and may all your birthday wishes come true"
she just does it for the pleasure cause she's too old to be a breeder
that is so sweet and what a flood
i don't care what you drive you'll never be able to run down this roadrunner beep - beep
"68' charger is lean, clean, and mean, this is a muscle car from end to end and love those hide away head lites"
this is my favorite body style of mustang and i love the curved rear end and tail lights and that beautiful longfastback
1967 hemi charger by dodge
everyone during this time period was making true muscle cars and what didn't come from the dealer you would add it on yourself
this takes you back to when nascar was all american muscle and if it ran on sunday you could buy it on monday 🇺🇸🇺🇸
absolutely beautiful machine and you know corvette c7. will have the horsepower to make you stands and take notice it will fly. 😎🚀✈
only a reporter like you brad could report on a story like this without getting personally involved or upset
uh oh didn't think that through
"oh what a surprise another ""eleanor"" it's a beautiful work of art just one too many of them. please don't get me wrong there cool"

"thank you for listening to my griping but even more so for calling me your friend as i feel that way about you ,thanks friend"
sorry rob to lay this on you i remember you said you had problems of your own so i'm very sorry to lay this on you
"then they lift me out and put me back in my wheelchair and life sets back in, but for alittle while i was a live again"
behind the wheel and slamming that pistol grip into those four gears it was the most alive i've felt in awhile
your not kidding to feel that car shake and those tires squealing and smell that rubber burning got it was great wish i was
tear that pussy up look at her grit her teeth for the next slam
eddie o is the only guy to speak up for the hawks he's a great announcer but he does play by play on comcast with pat
tonight even with a shutout they acted like the hawks were lucky and on the very last play they didn't give darling credit
your not kidding to hear those headers rumble and those big fat tires squeal and the smell of burnt rubber it was just great
"man i hate to watch the hawks games on nbcs those play by play announcers are truly anti blackhawk announcers, jerks"
"we sure do, on monday my grandson washed &amp; waxed the gtx then we went for a ride and on couple of side streets we opened it up"

the best goalie since tony. o and maybe better by the time he calls it quits
"hey you can't say that, maybe god can't carry a tune in a suitcase, it's not fair to jim !!! lol 😁😇😈😊"
"i wish i had taken photo of ""mr. norm grand spalding dodge"" were i bought a couple of cars and had work done"
yenko put out the some of the best high performance cars of 60's&amp; 70's
this challenger is coming up from hell you can see its still snorting fire
chevy never made an ugly nova and the bigger the engine the better the car
"oh you guys just broke my heart with the photo of that 67' charger, if it had been pearl white it would have been my car i miss it"
omg this woman is absolutely gorgeous my oh my outstanding!!😘
"oh i hope she's my guardian angel please, please, please."
now that's how you up date the general lee and make it smoke'n
just looking at this blacked out 55' chevy makes you think twice about trying to race it
she is very pretty but her wings should be repossessed they look rough
it seems that with every new challenger that comes out they only get better &amp; better than the last one except for the hellcat
i love this video of black charger burnout it sounds exactly like my 67' hemi bored &amp; stroked charger &amp; solid lifters
the back and left me paralyzed from the waist down

"when i came back from vietnam and they finished my tour, a year later i was in the police academy i spent 6yrs in uniform, then"
this is the baddest challenger on the planet a10 cylinder viper engine with twin turbo chargers which will blow your socks off
"red,black,or blue would have made that 55' chevy super mean yellow just means the driver is chicken shit"
"dad's final instructions were now son don't take her over 60mph, but the trooper clocked him at 180mph"
"if this car were any meaner looking it would be under arrest., black charger with supercharger"
holy shit thats the first mustang i think is very very cool and thats alot coming from an only mopar man
way to go ron and may lady luck keep riding in your hot rod
"you just can't beat a challenger and you can't stop hemi mopar, just ask wally"

i told you yesterday some of your stories are outrageous put the gun by the sprinkles wit str8 face
67' plymouth gtx
and i now have copd and last january i suffered heart and lung failure
how do your lungs look if you smoked for 15 years and you quit for 15 years and you were a heavy smoker
and i had 4 cars that were mopar's and two that weren't but i loved them all and i truly miss driving them all
rob these were the cars i've had: 1. 67'hemi charger 2. 67' hemi gtx 3. 69' hemi roadrunner ( stolen ) 4. 70' hemi challenger
your stories are serious but kind of borderline alittle outrageous but we know you're a serious reporter and you're a good guy
"brad you get some of the most outrageous stories, you lucky devil"
that's why i've sold them one by one except my 69' hemi roadrunner it was stolen back in 75' just after i'd painted it black.
"hi rob had busy day with therapy have come to terms with it, it's just life but i do miss driving my cars"
"back in the day my wife would wear her summer dress and go pantyless felt sorry for her boss, she would give him peeks only"
wish i could but probably before you were born i was a narc &amp; i was shot in the back in the line of duty and now i'm paralyzed
"i wish someone would bitch slap that little bastard, he just gets on my nerves"
i know i served 5 years in the u.s.m.c.&amp; 2 tours in vietnam never got a scratch come home and a 16 year old punk shoot me
it's the last of four mopars i had sold them over the years. see i was a cop and in 85' i was shot in a drug buy left paralyzed
i can live with that i still have 67' plymouth hemi gtx it's gonna go for sale at mecum auto auction
i'm a mopar guy my self but love those 69' &amp; 70' chevy's
"you sound like a cool guy god, family ,the corp and country sorry about the vikings but love your choice of cars"
a simple clean cuda is all badass nothing but 440cu under the hood and it will run you down!!!!
"god watched over him and may god bless him now and forever, this story made my wife cry"
but above all i'm a mopar man and i rather have that roadrunner over both camero's and that yenko next
"this camero is very clean, but i have to say i would rather have that yenko camero, sorry guys."

this blacked out charger is a demon of the night and it's a catch me if you can !!

aaah the love of my life mopar nothing better big power and style i owned a few and there was nothing better 426cu hemi nb
"there's nothing like a nova with some phat rubber on its ass that means big,big, power under her top. i just love nova's."

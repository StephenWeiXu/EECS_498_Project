you know a lot about anal glands.
christina aguilera is making me miss my long curly mermaid hair right now. what did i do????
these are audible toots. do glands make toots smell bad? or is it just because my dog has a brownie in the oven?
wow! i‚Äôve been working through my 32 bottles of detergent i got from my couponing sprees recently :) i‚Äôll try it when i run out!
"whatever it is, it‚Äôs terrible."
"very cool! i‚Äôm a floridian myself, i love boca!"
how does something so wretched and foul come out of something so fluffy and adorable?
"my dog is laying next to me while i work, and is passing the time by passing lethal toots."
i may also be working until 3am tonight :-/
oh cool! what‚Äôs your talk about?

"magic vs. hawks. one of us will be happy at the end of the game, no matter what."

"haha!!! true love is giving up raw onions. i still cook them, and put them in his food."
i‚Äôm kind of obsessed with my new haircut.
"i like a raw onion, but for the sake of my spouse, i‚Äôve not had any for the last 4 years."
pickled is good. caramelized is better. raw is not good for me or my breath.
"i am deep in the trenches of social media every day, and tonight, the internet gave us something nice. don‚Äôt mess it up, grumpy people."
that looks so good (with the exception of the red onion)
blue and black. duh.
i am already salt.
oh my goodness! who are you cooking all this delicious food for???
#thedress has made my night to the point that i‚Äôm up way past my bedtime to watch a hilarious fb post unfold.
"my husband does some great fish on the grill! i mean, on the barbie, lol."
"i should be working ahead for the weekend so i can spend it in orlando, instead i‚Äôm having a glorious time on twitter."
never underestimate the power of icymi
i tagged it with #thedress on fb in hopes that it would show up in the trending section on fb tomorrow
i wish more people were awake to revel in its awesomeness!!!! lol :)
i‚Äôm pretty sure the steak that was atop my salad tonight was not a filet.
i usually prefer fish over a steak. probably because i‚Äôm from florida.
the internet is a fun place tonight!
i usually only eat a filet if i have steak. i‚Äôm a steak elitist lol.
not sure. came out of nowhere. i posted this an hour ago to great fanfare.
the fun that brands are having with this white/gold blue/black thing is fabulous. myself included.
"it wasn‚Äôt a good cut. the longer i chewed it, the bigger it became in my mouth. it was growing."
i had steak on my salad with dinner tonight and it was very disappointing. even cooked very rare :(
and also meat is freaking delicious. i fell off the vegan bandwagon and into a giant plate of grilled salmon and just about died
"i follow macronutrients very closely now, and always maintain an appropriate ratio (unless pizza and beer happen)"
i hope you talk about #thedress tomorrow! and maybe this:
"when i was a vegan, i gained weight from the excess carbs. it was the opposite of what i expected. i was fat and hungry :("
that sounds like a slice of carbohydrate heaven.
that sounds amazing
rt gold and white? or blue and black? #thedress #thecookie
sending you a dm

so glad you made it! we ate every lunch there on our honeymoon.
we'll be in orlando this saturday night!

"are you going to tell us, or make us all wait? the anticipation is killing me."
"it was in the checkout line at the grocery store in response to my coupon savings. pretty dorky, i admit."
i know!!!! i‚Äôm so excited.
"go to order apple beet slaw, and thank me later. it‚Äôs like brighter day and whole foods had a baby."
i‚Äôve been wanting to read #girlboss! i should. thanks for the inspiration.
"keeps calling me dorky. am i dorky? i said ""whoop whoop!‚Äù twice in public. did that seal my fate?"

"‚Äúthanks, is the new ‚Äúthanks, obama‚Äù except carmax actually did something terrible."
"and then my stereo stopped working, which i believe is this car's version of flipping me the bird."
"it was in for a week, got it back a few days ago, and this morning it's dead again. what's this, number 9 think? thanks"
it spends more time in the service center than it does in my driveway.
"i've had my car for 18 months and i've had to replace the timing chain, alternator, oil leak, starter, and a lot more. cc"
never buy a car from i find this 125 point inspection hard to believe. i'm the most dissatisfied customer ever.

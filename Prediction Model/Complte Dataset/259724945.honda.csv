he could be. i'm big on digging deeper before i jump on a cause.

now that the #beastmaster joined #arrow i wonder if killer croc will show up? i think he might have experience fighting reptiles.
the best part of making #beastmaster references to tonight's #arrow is that an entire generation of kids has zero clue about the joke.
if they somehow add john amos to the cast of #arrow i'll die with glee. they have to get some ferrets into a background shot w/ singer!
"good episode, and the beastmaster joins the cast too!"

masao needs to stop moonlighting as an assassin and get back to design robot boxers. probably much better money. #arrow

if you know about me and choose to stay then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
how do you put greys aanatomy down to study for urban studies?
i don't understand people
me either 😬

rt if grey's hasn't at some point inspired u to be a surgeon then u don't really love grey's
um excuse me i was part of this... #rude

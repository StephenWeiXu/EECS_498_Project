i only want faze to win so it could be faze vs denial
rt rt to enter - if or win cod champs we'll pick someone to win a tub of gfuel #codchamps
both my brothers tax refund check came in the mail n mine is still yet to arrive :(
the shitty bracket is what made this happen.
you keep thinking that bud! done talking bout this now.
ar needs to win. i want denial to win cod champs since optic couldnt.
yea but he would never leave cus he doesnt care and it's all up on his teammates to vote him out the island lol but they wont
it's okay tho. he would never step down as captain like boze did no matter what.
"he knows that too. he made a remark about playing denial first which obviously felt threatened, clayster didnt he was ok w/ it"
just woke up n optic lost. no doubt denial is winning cod champs.
i don't like it. feels as if the teams that got bad placing in regionals got easier match ups.
"this is the worst tournament, worst bracket ever made."
i want faze to beat nv
maybe they will meet up in the losers back finals lol
are you at the event?
i'm convinced sushi is your favorite food
definately see you guys taking on this bracket
rt next on bravo: vs #epsilon or #sb? - #codchamps2015

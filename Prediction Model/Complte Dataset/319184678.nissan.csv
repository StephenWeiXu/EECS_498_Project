rt this picture that the n&amp;oâ€™s chuck liddy took of quinn cook is so powerful. if you didnâ€™t know the result of the gameâ€¦
very similar to something k said about gonzaga yesterday.

"rt matt jones told himself he was due and delivered, with big shots that produced the feeling #duke wouldnâ€™t be denied:"

thank you.
"man, i still canâ€™t believe it."
thanks. unforgettable.
always. learned a lot this weekend.
yo. just realized i lost a sparkle somewhere. how long has my right shoe been lookinâ€™ so rough? #sacrifice
"i have such a new respect for all that they do. but if any of them want to trade me a spot in indy for a spot in my classroom, i'll listen."
"but before i jump in the car, let me just say how in awe i am of these reporters doing this every day. they are everywhere."
it's been the dream of a lifetime. thanks for coming along with me. i'll understand if you jump off here. real life is no this life.
"well, folks that's all for me from houston. i've got a 5 hour drive ahead of me and then back to my real job at hand -- teachin' kids."
my phone has cut off on its own during every press conference recording but only when duke is on stage. they've got the mojo.
"rt ""we have 8 guys. half of them are freshmen. it's the youngest team i've ever had."" - k"
"k talks about how just making the tourneyt is big. ""and someone's going to call gonzaga's run a disappointment. they have 35 wins"""
"everyone thinks of duke as a machine, but guys in the locker room don't know how to cut down the nets. k: they're just 8 guys."
k: amile had 3 offensive rebounds. lack of turnovers made the difference.
k: calls justises's mother one of the great ladies.
"and that lrt is why i love k. that attitude. k: when you stop learning, you should retire. learning is what keeps you fresh."
are you still learning? k: a teacher should learn every year he/she has an opportunity to teach. amen. amen. amen.
k: i've said it the whole year. i love my team. i love my team. and they're taking me to indy.
what does tying wooden's 12th final four mean? k: my past is not important right now. i'm so happy for them and to be with them.
"k: matt gave us such a lift. he's done the dirty work. the texas boys played pretty well. 32 of 66 points. (after some mental math, lol)"
"k: 2nd half started rough defensively, but only 14 points in the last 16 minutes. that's a group effort."
"k: for these four games, we've played outstanding defense. in first half, we missed four assignments. felt good holding them to 26."
"go celebrate, quinn, matt, and tyus."
quinn: i wasn't thinking about the past. it's a new year and a new team. these guys trust me and amile as captains.
quinn says these guys aren't freshmen.
see my last tweet about matt. he's having trouble keeping his pro face too.
i wish i was the one!
matt jones hides a smile behind his towel when a reporter calls him the designated 3 point shooter today.
tyus on his brilliant out-of-bounds play: we had to make plays. coach tells us to be confident and not hang our heads.
quinn: we didn't let up on defense at all.
rt quinn is wearing the net around his neck.
quinn: i'm blessed to be a part of duke.
coach k has the red eyes. more flustered and shaky voiced than i've ever heard him.
mickie k on my row again. i think she wants to be friends.
rushing necessitates the ability to stand without falling over. pro face still good tho.
few mentions the missed lay-in. it was the momentum killer imo now. kudos to all of you who believed at the time. i was not so sure.
itâ€™s my favorite thing ever. thatâ€™s why teachers teach and coaches coach.
rt this is good stuff.
few says that the two early fouls kept karnowski from getting going. was surprised to see the double team from duke.
at what point should normal breathing resume? asking for a friend.
"no you just clapped for your hero, mike krzyzewski on press row. ah, eff it. i love you, mike."
"+1 real talk, never wanted it more for anyone rt quinn cook cutting down the net #duke"
the net is giving the blue devils some trouble. they haven't been practicing...
""
rt credit to coach k too. pressed all the right emotional buttons when team needed it.
"i'll take a piece of that birthday present too, mike. 39 is alright so far."
"rt have to think justise winslow gets south regional mvp, no?"
"quinn cook yesterday, ""we're fighting for our lives."" duke nation says, ""keep fighting."""
"rt that's all right, i may or may not have gotten something in my eyes just now"
thanks. so your name buddy today. he wouldn't get out of my way.
rt i'm almost crying in my living room so don't feel bad ðŸ˜‚
"rt now, you have to go! you make them undefeated."
full disclosure: i am shaking. this has been a dream come true. waited 29 years to see this in person.
welp. duke is 2-0 with me in the house. #factsonly
huge hug for quinn cook from k. crying on press row? bad or good?
rt texas boys be ballin'
akljkklsfgkmaklejrkkfkl! final four!
texas is showin' out today. justise and matt puttin' the whole state on their backs. and we're a big crazy state.
"and who grabs that? none other than matty j, texas legend. reppin' the metroplex, y'all."
at 0.0 you may travelocity. not until then.

"professional question: at the press conference, can i substitute my question for a justise winslow hug? anyone have a ruling on this?"
rt and winslow just big boyed ol t-shirt for that one. thatâ€™s shameful for gonzaga.
rt justise winslow has earned a spot on chucky oakfor's shirt.
rt sports loving teachers unite!
rt things in texas are best when win-slow cooked.
"i like you, lisa! rt idk, but i'm good with it. :-)"
justise ain't leavin' h-town sad.
might have to go full fan mode for a second y'all....
rt put chucky in for jah. would bring some enthusiasm.
by a thread.... #prayfornaz
quick question: prayer on press row -- professional or unprofessional?
the lady behind me is having my heart attack for me. god bless her.
wiltjer going schoolyard bully on matt jones. and gets a little karmic retribution.
and here comes matt jones.
how do you define okay?
rt your butts. hold on to them.
"rt kevin pangos today: two points, three turnovers."
karnowski joins the trey club. but not the good kind.
winslow went skyscraper window washer on that one.
"yesterday, media had zero questions for matt jones in press conference (including me). we see you now, matt."
matty j has room on his back for errbody.
sweet give-and-go by tyus. that kid is quick.
"rt real talk, that was the smartest thing iâ€™ve ever seen and iâ€™ve seen good will hunting and a beautiful mind a combined 47 tâ€¦"
he fits right in with the houston skyline.
mark few cannot call that timeout fast enough.
jah must be checking my feed.
marshall plumlee is hype after that. jumped straight up even with the stage.
not even looking at the basket. it's very strange.
always. rt texas forever
matty j remembered he's in texas. shootin' at will.
karnowski provides quite a screen to shoot behind. like pangos's own black curtain.
and a gorgeous drive by winslow.
"cowbell kid is back. seems a little more toned- down today. live for the moment, kid."
where would duke be without quinn cook? has been so invaluable.
"i love you, quinn cook. (editorial comment)"
duke's gotta wake up soon. zags are feelin' it.
isolation for tyus = no rebounders. and gonzaga takes full advantage.
oh... dear. crowd letting jah have it after that one.
rt huge crank of the first and arm from k after the matt jones corner 3 went down. like he was waving a runner home from thiâ€¦
"and matty j says, ""not today."""
huge ovation for former president bush during the salute to armed forces.
"yesterday, quinn cook said they were playing for their lives. let's see if they do."
and just like that... it's all tied up.
rt do this for anthony boone and jamison crowder
duke band stealin' my dance moves. i don't know who you should feel sorrier for there.
"zags w/ a slight edge in fg%, but there was a stretch where duke made some pretty questionable decisions. would've greenlit gigli 2 there."
"know that i loved you all..,"
sheâ€™s a sweat mopper.
she was just in media room. she saw me. had to avert my eyes.
thst got stuck on a loop on my phone. terrifying bc sheâ€™s right in front of me.
aggie women's track and field national champs on the floor.
just a taste. we still need a little coher... lol never mind. get it.
"and halftime it is. duke closes out with a bit more intensity, taking advantage of some gonzaga foul trouble."
1-2-2 press in effect.
rt sabonis with excellent fundamentals - two hands on the chest pass into jefferson's chest there
sabonis picks up his third. could be huge.
lot's more contact than that all game though.
"lowered shoulder = easy call for the ref. not good, bob."
"and there he is,"
"he sometimes gets caught waiting on that double team, and then when it doesn't come, he's lost."
very disconnected.
"stop. now. rt ok. i confess, basketball gods. i was looking at indy hotel prices. i'll stop."
"zags giving the devils a taste of their own fast break medicine, and k is unhappy about it."
"rt tyus jones, who somehow was cleared to play this weekend, scores on a floater #conspiracy"
tyus with a sweet kiss off the glass. and wiltjer breaks the seal on gonzaga's 3 pointers
much more aggressive with that trap. have been leading the ball handler.
last offensive possession was very strange for okafor.
over the back foul call. junior high parents everywhere smile.
okafor looking a lot tougher on defense these days.
winslow back. houston smiles.
rt two fouls on karnowski. getting a little dicey for the zags' long-term prospects
that 2-2-1 is back. *swoon*
i web md'd it. you're good.
#factsonly rt you started a new streak.
justise just snatched that like i'm afraid everyone at the metro is gonna snatch my bag. #smalltownkidfears
and quinn cook gets in on the action.
"duke giving kenpom the ""what's up nod"" about now."
grayson on wiltjer giving up a 2 year-old on his shoulders height differential.
bright green shirt/ navy sweater. on the corner of the court under the gonzaga basket. literally right up against the court
i'm going to say that this is not too shabby to watch.
wiltjer could be the key for gonzaga. just straight musclin' down low.
matty j doesn't believe in kenpom.
pace is just a tad faster than friday. jussssttt a tad.
"wiltjer is determined to use his size against any and everyone. so far, getting his way from the refs."

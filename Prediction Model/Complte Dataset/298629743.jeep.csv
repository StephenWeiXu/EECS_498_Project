this is not the same team i've watched for many years come out on e...they play every period like it's their last!
how can i loose faith when the players haven't lost faith...they leave it all on the ice every game!

and gudbranson is probably out for the rest of the season
goallllll!!!!! come on boys!!!! #beattherangers
#beattherangers come on fellas!
for thorton?
so how does that work? we take our prospects to the other team?
"i'd like to get steve johnson,michael crabtree, or reggie wayne that's in the order i'd pick"
damn i want to go but i'm making next saturday my last game... i have to watch the bos fla game
yeah because we have a game in hand on washington
plus we have a game in hand on washington
i kind of want the opposite with washington loosing 4 straight i think it would be better for them to keep no momentum
""
rt i'm starting to believe that this is how the nhl refs view the goalies... and it's unacceptable!
i can agree with that...i just think they need to make a bold move...
yeah but i've seen so many times where a team puts all their eggs in one basket and that talent just gets wasted
that's why i think a trade with malkin could easily help their team they could get 2 players and 2 picks easy
they could trade malkin for several players and picks idk it's just sad they somehow always fall apart when they're great
i wonder if it's time to consider taking a bold move...i respect the pens they're great but always have issues
alright my twitter fans-family time to get it going! rt or use the hashtag #beattherangers

he loves to fetch this is him now
feel off naturally so he doesn't know any different he centered that back leg up and now he runs just as fast as any other cat
"he was born with 3 legs, friends were here from ocala and their cat had a litter obilical cord was wrapped around his leg"
i also have two other cats and he owns this place! they don't fight bad but he likes to pounce on them when they walk by lol
he will sit behind my wife's head lick her and brush up on her and let's us cradle him like a baby and carry him around

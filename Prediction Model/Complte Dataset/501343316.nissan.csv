zags never made an effort to shoot 3s. difference in the game
winslow is by far the best wing duke has had since dunleavy. and probably right up there with hill and dawkins
idk if yall have noticed but okafor has been silent these last 2 games. he'll have a shot saturday night tho
rt might be a wrap there. winslow‚Äôs so damn good.
that was the dagger.

lmao. this nigga!
few gets down and i know he's going hack-a-okafor
glad we can all agree on that lmao
3 is always &gt; 2
college coaches kill me telling player to help off a corner 3 for a drive.
quite a start to the 2nd half
i know duke will win this game. just hoping for the upset
if sabonis doesnt make 2 stupid offensive fouls the game is different. zags gotta get that 3rd on jah early #anybodybutduke
rt duke started 8-for-12 from the field. since: 2-for 14 fg
dont act like you werent tweeting after every basket in the first 4-5 minutes....cc:
#allday
uk was so good they let wiltjer leave. he's an offensive beast and uk didnt need him
if pangos hits a 3 or two before the half things will get very interesting
7 minutes since last tweet. what happened?
tyus jones is the next dukie i'll hate. nobody has filled the void since scheyer and singler
foolish
wait. you're saying he didnt deserve it last year???

"this is just hitting the length of an nba game. not too bad with the fouls, timeouts and ot"
"because izzo doesn't adjust. which, i agree, is stupid"
if you watched louisville this year you knew that they cant shoot. this is why i didnt want them here. terrible offense
rt amazing. rt louisville is in overtime having made 5 whole shots from the field in the second half.

ooooo of course
how are you watching it??
rt just the first half we wanted. teams have stayed close to kentucky for 25-30 minutes often this season. we'll see how l‚Ä¶
after the half uk gotta let the choppa sing. i need lobs to wcs
notre dame played about as well as they could and it's tied. uk force fed the post and didnt really try to get 3s.
somehow uk is gonna be up 3 or 4 at the half. then that balloons into a 8 or 9 pt lead in the 2nd half
"rt no offense to nd, but a bunch of teams went 7 rounds with uk this season."
it was inevitable. now brey goes zone and uk should get some open 3s
kaminsky will get in foul trouble vs towns. he's a contact magnet
i'm ready for the open 3s off the double team
2 on auguste. a uk run will ensue...
kentucky gets this 2nd on colson and auguste and it gets real
he's a 7 footer who can bang down low. easy low first rd pick.
did you notice how easy those hooks were that towns missed?
dakari will be gone too
i'll say it again: marcus lee cuts that mohawk and his playing time increases
rt always a winner.
it's not that uncommon but i get your point
oooo
wisconsin got a bench full of black players?
lol it worked out perfectly this past decade. i'm sure it will again
"that was actually the perfect ""gotta get ready to pregame and party"" nap from my youth"

those people arent living right lol. and walmart is a trash shopping experience unless it's in the suburbs
the debit card links directly to your debit card. so as long as you have a bank acct you're good
yup. with the red card (debit or credit)
target does 5% off everything which almost equals walmart. plus you're getting a better experience

true. dont know if he can facilitate like harden. but nobody (in college) can stop him getting to the rim
but it's a terrible business decision. no guaranteed money as a 2nd rd pick
"his ceiling is harden so i tend to agree. okafor is scary, just dont trust a 1-way center. need a defensive anchor"
first saw in 2012 u-17s and knew he was a monster. looking like a top 10 pick
""
they're both listed as 2nd rd picks by i'd take whichever is the sg tho

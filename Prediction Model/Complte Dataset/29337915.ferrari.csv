got to believe that turning back time on timehop would be amazing. some of her tweets are class.
"there just isn't much to like about the team sadly. poor management, rather weak drivers and a weird social media set up."
rt we've chosen our top dog for the #malaysiagp - it isn't sebastian vettel‚Ä¶ do you agree?
i doubt any would be quick in coming forward now after the antics in melbourne...
does lewis hamilton have a new rival!? üòú üèÅüèÜ
being a pop star sounds like a lot of shit sometimes. privacy is sacred these days.
mclaren have found themselves back in 1995 just like alonso...
try the website perhaps?
power apparently hit jpm. wing damage for power. #indycar
montoya is doing well in the basketball...
makes sense.
they did. they showed it till 10:30. they don't have to show any more if they choose not to. it seems like an automatic thing.
basketball is trash imo.
they never normally switch back.
first time i've ever seen them do that tbh.
they never normally do.
look at the schedule. was always ending at 10:30.
that's the schedule.
espn quit the show at 10:30.
good grief montoya is leading the #indycar race! the day of nostalgia continues with gusto.
what a stunning little baby it is as well! never too early to get them into f1.
someone needs to blue shell will power...
they get told not to in indycar until the safety team arrives.
i have two two day weeks in april! lovely month.
there hasn't been a single overtake since lap 1.
#indycar needs drs.
p.s determined to get that schuey article done and dusted this week. seems fitting given today!
oh. that's a bummer. :(
someone give an #indycar stream...
simon pagenaud seems to have swapped his red michael schumacher lookalike helmet design for a yellow ralf schumacher lookalike one. #indycar
those #indycar aero kits look absolutely horrific. less really is more sometimes.
think montoya will be my man for #indycar this season. either him or tk.
sato.
"a german winning for ferrari, rossi winning on the bikes and montoya at the front in indycar... ...is this really 2000? #f1 #motogp #indycar"
being this light at 19:00 is messing with my head.
"for those who think vettel can't win from anything other than pole, today was the 13th time he has done just that. #f1"
"rt vettel: ""michael [schumacher] was my hero, i looked up to him. that's why today is so emotional and very special."""
very much so! don't think the merc top brass will be impressed.
lauda seems happier ferrari won than mercedes! #f1
rt the german anthem followed by the italian one. it just feels right... #keepfightingmichael #malaysiagp
nope. monza 2008.
also as always #forzajules. also a member of the family. #f1
"rt seb with the old schumi conducting of the italian national anthem. what a dream come true for him, emulating his idol. #skyf1"
rt j'esp√®re que d'une mani√®re ou d'une autre michael schumacher voit cela et peut en avoir conscience. #grandmoment #f1ismagic
it's going to be so amazing!
same!
i wonder how is feeling!?
rt sebastian vettel wins ferrari's 75th grand prix with a german driver #keepfightingmichael
nope. vettel for toro rosso monza 2008.
ga. didn't have a choice though.
see you there then indeed!
you going?
sebastian vettel. grand prix winner! nice one. michael schumacher would be a very proud man. very proud. #f1
what a year to win a trip to the italian grand prix. ferrari and vettel look mighty. raikkonen too back on form. #f1
well i'd agree but you know how the latest update about michael was. i hope he is smiling.
what did he say?
"rt so, red bull racing, who are you going to blame now? thoroughly trounced by your junior team"
this could have been a ferrari 1-2 if raikkonen hadn't been hit at the start of the race. merc have to notice that. #f1
i don't think there's anything wrong with saying it reminds one of schuey. we all know vettel is vettel.
this drive does remind me of schumacher's in 1998 tbh.
"ok so, come on vettel! get the job done. do schumi proud. #keepfightingmichael #f1"
better than half the rubbish in the top 40.
oh how to be a fly on that wall!
well he was catching vettel big time. hamilton clearly furious with his team. #f1
hamilton gaining in vettel hand over fist at the moment. race on! #f1
there was no chop. hulk made a mistake into t1 and should have backed out. simple.
because he deserved it.
hamilton eating vettel alive now. #f1
the drivers seem to think today is a boxing match rather than a motor race. stop hitting each other! #f1
hamilton in the pound seat right now. merc much better on mediums.
10 second pen coming.
remember the rain. could hand the race to either driver on a platter. #f1
merc will be on mediums and much happier though. race far from finished. especially with rain coming.
"depends how hard the merc is on tyres, looks big degradation. race not over."
nah not yet.
should have backed out given he made a mistake going into 1. corner was dany's.
hammer time. this is where lewis can win the race. #f1
i don't think sparks should be coming off the red bull brakes. big issues. #f1
mclaren's race pace looked decent. way better than oz. late season could be far more fruitful than i thought. #f1
romp is a good word.
no idea why ferrari stayed out. later hamilton will romp away.
ham is holding the gap now. merc still hold the cards.
thought you might!
not at all. hamilton uber fav for race now unless it surprise rains!
bad afternoon for sauber given they paid vdg ‚Ç¨15million not to drive in ericsson's car. ericsson's mistake was woeful. #f1
vettel not stopping has ruined the entire afternoon i fear. #f1
what was said?
spending the evening watching the 1992 cart season. those race cars were absolutely mental! #indycar
""
"if it rains it'll be delayed, no doubt about that. we saw today they won't go racing until inters weather."
says thunderstorms still more likely than not on mine.
indeed and blaming the driver on this occasion was completely out of line. completely.
he made an appalling joke about bianchi and marussia last year as well. he clearly isn't a nice man.
"very sad news from the #nurburgring. thoughts with the deceased, the injured and the driver of car #23 #nissan"
an accident happened and someone lost their life. it should be a time where respects are made not digs at drivers involved.
it isn't the first time he's been an insensitive moron.
"here are racing career stats, as you will see he was absolutely rubbish. #f1"
. you might want to review your entire 1995 #f1 season before judging anyone else's driving you muppet.
i vote or for a female doctor. both have sass and style with bags of emotion.
for some reason that reminds me of that famous photo of senna winning at portugal in 85.
i have no idea. i didn't look at it very long because i fear there may be some rather horrifying reports later.
my only question upon seeing the image is how on earth did it manage that!? glad driver got out ok.
two places!? pah. you can get that back in 200 yards with a lightning start!
...in the last race of the season. by one point!
the andretti's and the unser's being the main case. in fact in 1984 al unser beat al unser jr. to the cart title...
vettel can win this race tomorrow. #f1
how close did vettel get to his first ferrari pole!? #f1
he's got a handy margin...
already got my ferrari top ready!
we got him to speak!
:o is he feeling ok?
still expecting a lewis pole. especially in these conditions. #f1
how long did that last!?
the ferrari's are much better this year!
i wonder if someone will have one at wec?
do it!
they've had lightning since oz...!?
do monza! me and are going!
only a couple! ;)
shh! i said some!
some hamilton fans can calm down. quali would continue tomorrow morning just like aus 2013. still too late for raikkonen. #f1
this isn't football. they'll either take q2 as grid or hold q3 tomorrow morning.
if q3 can't get going then q2 times will make grid.
getting q2 out of the way made sense since everyone had the same chance to set one flying in it. some won. some lost
"i doubt it. the last light of the day is only about an hour away, they'll want q3 under way as soon as poss."
rt it's currently 17:42 local time in sepang. sunset is at 19:22 this evening #f1
no red flag i'd assume because they wanted to avoid keeping going until last light of the day. #f1
"little point red flagging, just let the session dwindle away and delay q3. light will start fading soonish."
lewis shut up. you got through. #f1
won't dry in time even if it did.
"raikkonen, rain, ferrari and sepang just don't work do they? get the ice cream ready. #f1"
rain will pass by quite quickly. track should dry fast in the heat too. q3 might be delayed though.
"cars on slicks, biblical rain coming fast and a massive likelihood of a banker lap then a twirl or two as they scramble back to the pit. #f1"
best send them out in an ark for q2 now then boys and girls! about to hammer down in a biblical way. #f1
you can hear the thunder over brundle's mic. sounds bloody terrifying! #f1
also stop asking for live times. it's clear that fom won't be providing them on screen and you have to buy a ¬£20 app now. shame. #f1
get the feeling q2 will be the deciding session. those clouds look session ending. #f1
i don't take anything bernie says seriously.
i was the oldest person on shift tonight at work. that's never happened before.
looking at the forecast for #f1 qualifying in kuala lumper and wouldn't be shocked to see a washout. 80% chance of heavy thunderstorms.
i'd like his thoughts on this gem from in 1997 #f1 -
remember when #f1 teams would try mental new things on fridays? this was at monza 1997. very slippy!
"thing is they don't, they either rent them out to wear for the evening or get given them for free."
yep and he criticised hamilton for getting too distracted by pop star girlfriends at the same time.
two years ago bernie claimed vettel was the best ambassador the sport could have. he's a moron.
kay burley being kay burley has the same level of irritation as a period stain on your favourite pair of knickers. #battlefornumber10
rt weird
then sauber will sign ten new presenters to replace him.
they just declared they want them to cook again on #masterchef. groundbreaking stuff.
with respect this is not cool guys.
he's not dead. nor has his face fallen off.
"still good news directioners, whsmith will have a tonne of merchandise with a fifth off tomorrow..."
you and i are never going to agree on this so i'm stepping away.
wrong.
zayn malik was the one who could never sing or dance in one direction anyway. they've lost precisely nothing except some hairdressing bills.
there's a case for all three with clarkson. most certainly there was a victim.
not national news either. employee gets sacked for committing criminal offence.
a kid from a boyband quitting is not national news. get your bloody priorities sorted britain.
"rt can i just say, yesterday was a ‚Äòtragedy‚Äô, today is just a guy from the tv who did something silly and is moving on."
he cares alright.
if you think punching someone doesn't warrant dismissal then i'm glad i won't ever be working for you.
he should have thought about that before bursting a producer's lip.
"rt whatever about the incident, i think a fresh tg line up is a couple of series overdue anyway #topgear"
put it this way if you were the boss and an employee hit another employee over a steak you'd sack them immediately.
calling clarkson an adult is like calling an egg a sausage.
no but he needs two hip replacement ops.
rt ‚úª breaking‚Äî ‚úª employer sacks abusive employee... ‚úª #clarkson fans devastated to discover popularity doesn't trump everyt‚Ä¶
in this case it seems as clear as day to me. clarkson wasn't provoked.
well said nickie. tg was close to having it's day anyway and clarkson's health was catching up with him.
"you assault an employee, you get the sack. as it should be regardless of who you are. time to move on."
his own fault. he assaulted an employee and that is a straight off sackable offence regardless of who he is.
he should have thought about that first then.
bernie thinks european viewers will appreciate an extra hour in bed and no race...
"the kind of rain predicted for sunday would mean no race, there'd just be too much water."
he of course would have known a lot more inside goings on than us as well! i can see ricciardo moving on soon as well.
after suzuka last year and the levels of rain we see in sepang there won't be a race if it rains. too dangerous.
...he have chosen to leave rb. easy to see where it all fell into place for this year now.
it seems to have been brewing since winter testing last year. vettel always promised ferrari first refusal on him should...
red bull are making remarkably easy to see why seb vettel jumped ship to ferrari though. #f1
rt #f1 big vtt test rigs are normally used only by engine manufacturers. looks like red bull is preparing to go that step in the‚Ä¶
if it rains don't expect a race.
the audi rumours remain just that.
well would you want to pump hundreds of millions into something that isn't fighting at the top?
"him, cameron and clarkson have got exactly what they wanted. a bbc on the brink."
can anyone honestly see red bull remaining in #f1 beyond 2016? a sell-out is coming fast.
"rt #f1 starting in may, red bull will check renault engines on avl test rigs in austria. trust ist gone. amus (german):"
sad 150 people lost their lives today in a plane crash yet all the media will talk about tomorrow is an oaf who can't control himself.
just pretend you landed in the tardis. doesn't matter what time it is.
i think nando made his debut in 2001 johnny... ;)
. the only thing you developed taki was a dent on the bonnet of that hungarian medical car... #f1
someone needs educating...
"ouch! rt renault has conceded it won't have a ""race-winning engine on merit"" this year. #f1"
i think you missed my point.
you have to wonder how good the development will be on the car this year as a result.
in the last 13 months 1093 people have been killed in plane crashes. the 18 months previous to that was less than 250. terrible year.
perfect flying weather apparently.
don't really care by the looks of it.
exactly a year ago i was landing in jfk. next year i'll be returning. the next 12 months will be absolutely crazy!
can we not ask/pray/hope for rain in sepang this coming sunday please. remember this? #f1
this time last year i was on my way to heathrow to get a plane to new york. time flies.

shits going down in my room today
okay i'm really pissed at my psych prof for making us write in apa format. i'm about ready to just write mla and go to the writing lab
and 3) that's the third person within maybe two weeks that mentioned me and j getting married....am i missing something
2) we still have a few years before that's going to happen lol
"and i just sat there, dumbfounded because 1) it makes me happy that other people think j and i could/should get married but"
"...my mother just showed me this really gorgeous park/venue and was like, ""you and jamison should get married here."""
"rt once back, it's april, and i begin countdown to saint anything pre-tour (mid april) and release/actual tour (may 5!). eeek‚Ä¶"
"...since all of my abc family shows just ended, what am i going to do on monday's and tuesday's?"
i just had such a big realization
i don't even remember the last time i was out at 11pm when i wasn't at work lol
rt
also i love that i'm included at this family dinner
it's very extremely tense as the entire family tries to help heather figure out what she wants
alexander and heather have been engaged for almost eight months and they keep changing their mind on if they're eloping or having a ceremony
i think i just went deaf
holy crap i'm so freaking sore and tired i don't want to go to work
and now it's time to go to sleep because i have to be at work again in the morning üòî but then i have three days off so it's all good!
watching impractical jokers is always a good idea
omg bless
well shit
i've worked here for a month and they already have me counting money üòÇ
i got to help this newlywed couple shop today and i love personal shopping man
okay there's no reason to be a jerk to me just because i'm still technically new. i know how to do my job. you can stop now.
i'm feeling very adult-like today.
yo i just made the best breakfast sandwich ever
"i'm so happy bc i just found out that as long as i get my financial aid back before the summer semester, i can get my a.a. next spring!!"
jk it's still broken
(jamison fixed my bookshelf as best as it can so that i can have it until i get a new one)
someone tell me how i should organize my books if all of my paperbacks need to go on the top shelf
i need coffee. stat. and then i have soooo much homework to do. stat.
i hate working until midnight because it screws up my sleep schedule üòî
yall i know what car i want to get when my lease is up for my kia üòÅüòÑ
got out earlyyyy üëç
i'm sorry :( i probably can next week but i'm broke as mess haha
i have a bunch of homework to do before work :/
sushi is the one thing i don't hate myself for when i buy! lol
i'm literally just thinking out loud/on twitter. sorry yall
"then again, it's food i'm buying. so maybe i just hate myself for buying food."
"like i don't get off work until midnight, so i go to chickfila on my lunch break and spend not even $5 and i kind of hate myself for it"
"i don't know what is is, but i hate spending money on myself. that includes necessities, like food or water. is that bad?"
"also, i love telling people how old i am. ""you're only 19?!?! you're not in your 20's?!?!"""
and then i had to rush to work because i woke up late lol
i woke up from my nap and jamison had my favorite starbucks drink by my bed waiting for me! üíï
love it!!
i'm sad because we can't print the chapbook in color üòî meaning we won't be able to see the awesomeness of our winning photography and art
i really love editing &lt;3
"but then i have like 5 short stories, two other non fiction, and like 20 poems to edit lol"
except now i'm just about to edit the nonfiction works. which isn't that fun
"i'm editing the top three placing works in three categories. 6 down, 3 to go!"
"heeeellloooo, copy editing"
i really wish it'd thunderstorm. it's been a while
rt
rt
i'm finally laying down üôå
my poor dog ate a bee and now her head is swollen :( i had to go to three different stores before i found proper medicine
i'm so really tired
we have everything decided on what is going in the literary magazine and what it placing!! ahhhh!!
me too! i hope the book gets to me in time!
heck yeah i am :) i'm so excited! i wanted it to be a surprise but i guess the cats out of the bag... haha
this shift is going by way too slowly oh my gosh
"i always get to work way too early lol. but that's a good thing, right?"
for both of us!!
dang. mine's an online class so i emailed her and was like yo nobody is going to know what to do so hopefully it works out
my book shelf just collapsed
...how to write an entire research paper in apa format. and we're going to wrongfully copy it from online in a rush. sigh.
...our research paper in apa if the same college doesn't even require to teach it in the english classes?? nobody is going to know...
"in any collegiate english class i've ever taken, they have not require to teach apa format. so why should professor require that we write..."
my psych paper has to be in apa format...how the hell does one write in apa format
"rt i need 5 billion dollars, a cute puppy, and to sleep for 4 days"
holy cow i missed and its cheesy comments ‚ù§Ô∏è
i have a busy day tomorrow! work in the morning and lit mag after. woo!
i think the best feeling ever is when my category editors tell me how great of an editor in chief i am. it makes me want to cry a bit
why am i so pale? i was only outside for a few hours
i have a sunburn :(
so yeah we had a cherry picker to get jamison's plane out of the three lol
rt srry for triple texts i can't gather thoughts into 1 message
"also, i wanted it to be a surprise, but i feel like i can't hide it anymore... i'll be in nyc the week of the release :)"
"this is the third book contest i've won, but the first arc! i'm so excited :)"
i can't believe that i won the arc of new book from
although my other online class is great. my prof gives me extra credit every time i email her about an assignment or a question
...*an eight page research paper with five scholarly peer-reviewed articles. never once mentioned. boy am i excited!
...my prof never posts anything. we have to just go by the syllabus and turn everything in wherever it needs to go. this include a...
you know what i love about college? online classes. you know the one thing i hate about online classes? (at least this one class?)...
i'm excited to read #citylove by enter to win an arc of her new book from
this speaks to me
but really #charlesisa

"it's different than what i'm used to, and it's very hot in here..."

i really want to hurry up with my education so that i can start editing as a career. but at least i have the lit mag...

at least to be a human in tune with their emotions
"yeah that's true too, i guess your emotions and creativity kinda tie together. perhaps you do need creativity"
"i feel like they're different bc when i'm feeling a certain way, sad or any type of emotions, i don't think of creativity"

i dont think so. i feel like your emotions and your creativity are completely different from each other.
ay i got a nice counter argument too. shoot let me just write your paper
what makes us human is our ability to feel emotions and pain in a way that no other species can 😟

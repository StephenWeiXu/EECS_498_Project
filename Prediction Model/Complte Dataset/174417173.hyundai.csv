t mobile has always been good to me. i've had them since 2006 and never had a problem with them. at&amp;t on the other hand...
the fact pandora is data free when you have t-mobile is pretty cool. especially when i get bored of all the songs on my phone.

"look - the shield is back, only its not ambrose or rollins, it's now just like 10 random cops. #wrestlemania"

"just changed my trending topics to soweto, south africa, as to avoid walking dead spoilers."

at least undertaker doesn't have one of those weird penis-shaped haircuts this year. #wrestlemania
very nice of the wwe to employ homeless bag people for bray wyatt's entrance this year. how humane. #wrestlemania
the rock-rousey-authority segment took so long that bray/undertaker didn't get a hype video. #wrestlemania
"haha, great minds think alike."
rock's entrance has lasted longer than the entire divas match did. #wrestlemania
"michael cole says the ""star of furious 7"" is coming out. are they coming out with an ashtray filled with paul walker, then? #wrestlemania"

"think about this: john cena and daniel bryan holding mid-card titles is about to be a ""thing."" #wrestlemania"

rt i'm proud to live in an america that allows both man and cyborg to wrestle in the same ring. #breakdownthewalls.
so nice of sting to wrestle in gear tonight instead of a t-shirt like he did for a lot of the last part of his tna run. #wrestlemania
i hope the terminator robots come to life and fight the asians from sting's entrance to the death. #wrestlemania
sting is wondering how with ideas like that wwe won and wcw lost. #wrestlemania
sting is looking at hhh like he just re-enacted the shockmaster.
arnold's eyes aren't like that through special effects. he just had an extra dose of crack this morning before #wrestlemania
"hhh has become a cyborg. now he's going to rule wwe for the next 1,000 years or until edward furlong overthrows him. #wrestlemania"

i liked big show... ...when his father died and big boss man dragged his casket &amp; said rude shit to his mother.
big show winning the battle royal is like when you get excited the stupid opera is over then joe chill murders your parents in front of you.
big show is young and hungry. oh. wait. he's just hungry. ...well shit.
big show winning is like when you take a girl's pants down and her pussy stinks. #wrestlemania
big show is going to have anal sex with the andre the giant trophy up his ass. #wrestlemania

best beating ever.
my mom walked by when i was watching that beating when it first happened and said it was the most evil thing ever. i laughed.

there is a rumor that reid did his hammy last night. any truth in this at all?
you don't need the 3 pts we do...!!
newcastle - a place where you don't sit on a 4 goal lead...lol
"yep, krul to make a series of amazing saves, you just watch..."
i saw you only have 13 fit players for tonight's match...been taking lessons from pies??
about 2 chances 😂😂😂
then why don't all the top players play in those tournaments? the players is seen as the 5th major.
best thing about tonight's game - it wasn't for 4 points. #nabchallenge
what about the wgc's &amp; the players????
we just don't give cloke any chance at all to mark the ball. just kick and hope.
"don't worry we should be able to use the ""we've got lots of injuries"" excuse... #nabchallenge"
😬😬😬
big crowd...
i know - every team makes the finals !!
start with s/f best of 7 then the finals best of 9 !!
rt four teams remain... #cwc15
could have started with s/f line up...
should be packed house...lol
nz make their 7th cricket world cup semi final. so far 0 from 6 ...
so the best 4 teams are in the semi finals. didn't take long to get to this point at all 😜 #cwc15” only about 1/3 of a year!!
at this stage i'll say australia vs nz in the final. #cwc15
wi are all out and nz win... semi finals pretty much as many predicted. #cwc15
wi are scoring at 8 runs an over and yet still need 7 runs an over to win... #nzvwi
much more entertaining
wi are going to lose but they're going down swinging #nzvwi
but we have 40 players ready to play they all can't play.
but that should be the way. if you got good replacements then they get a game.
they might play pk - former lions player and all that.
fish &amp; chips ?
you could setup it up at home...and charge the neighbourhood for it..
see how helpful am i !!
food....
wi are just about down and out. so the s/f are... nz vs saf - tuesday aust vs india - thursday. #cwc15
"martin, take the wifi with you after you leave..."
"rt final teams: bench: goldsack, blair, greenwood, ramsay subs: crisp, gault emergencies: kennedy, broomhead, karnezis #gop…"
spot on with the outs
"rt collingwood leaves out karnezis, broomhead, kennedy from final line-up v dogs. crisp and gault are starting subs #nabchalle…"
rt chris gayle is the first player to hit 7 sixes in his first 50 runs of an odi innings.
brilliant 50 from chris gayle. some of the best hitting you'll ever see. #nzvwi
gayle has 7x 6's 1x 4 and one walk .... #nzvwi
rt this was the amazing catch by vettori on the boundary. on top in wellington
if reid plays 18-20 matches during the whole year i'd be more than happy.
"that's true, thou clearly they are taking a very cautious approach with reid."
well if gayle hits another 30x 6's wi might have a chance... #nzvwi
they want to manage him. make sure he has had 2x vfl matches plus more intense training before playing afl
that's is just pure ass... #nzvwi
god this ground is a postage stamp. reckon if maxwell faced 80 balls at this ground he would hit 25x 6's #cwc15
gayle goes booooooooooooommmmm again
"gayle goes boom, booooooom then booooooooooooooommmm #nzvwi"
yes i believe so daniel.
"yes, thanks paul. all good. now on 12 month schedule rather than 6 month as surgery was coming up to 3 yrs ago."
based on last night's game think we are down to just 4 injuries. #itcantlastsurely
pk has played both nab matches hasn't he?
see even old stadiums can come back to life... #footypark
"ok now i can sit down and watch the cricket then the footy, work done for the day."
have we named our team for tonight? ??
abv #bupassfinal
i know it's early days - but seems we might have nearly close to 40 players to choose from for rd 1 vs lions. #nicechange
nice report on training for thursday on giving a good run for his money :p
"and ur right wes, england nothing really since finalist back in 1992."
what really sticks out for me is the decline in the wi. only 1x sf since 1983.
team performances displayed graphically over the history of the world cup.
der i can't read man utd made it last year as well
chelsea made 1/4 finals last year...
didn't spurs qualify last year?
first time since 2002 i think...
rt the official result of the #ucldraw: which quarter-final are you looking forward to most?
monaco
what about... atletico madrid v real madrid !!
couple of reasonable games in #ucl 1/4 finals!!
rt champions league quarter finals: psg vs barcelona atletico vs real madrid porto vs bayern juventus vs monaco
rt atlético v real madrid #ucldraw
rt psg vs barcelona
i might have to get in the car. light pollution a real issue here. i guess look south ---&gt;&gt; south east ?
"rt one has told you before, america. there is no such thing as american english. there is english &amp; there are mistakes."
rt video: hear from darcy moore - following his return from a toe injury in vfl match practice
much better...
what was yours??
would it be visible from adelaide?
it is a balance act for sure.
i would reckon they would have gotten another 7-10k if priced properly...
plus then add in the stupid $8 booking fee...
the good seats at $90 just too much should have been $55-65. best seats around $90.
we're basically in the final playing our summer bunnies next game...
"in the end did it easy, but looked a little trouble when the skipper went..."
the cheap seat (on the hill) were $50...
"yeah right - who an hour ago was tweeting ""i'm nervous again"" lol"
should have been $40 $55 &amp; $85 and i would have gone...
there was no discount for members just they got first choice for tickets before public...
rt no club or association in the country had access on their membership
there was no members area for the 1/4 final. icc took over the whole ground.
nope there was no free for members
australia win !!! 👏👏👏👍👍👍✔️✔️✔️ #ausvpak
$150 to sit in members stand - that's way too much much
reckon riaz might be appearing before the match ref tonite for the verbal spray... #ausvpak
australia basically into the s/f now... #ausvpak
"35,516 crowd tonite- blame the shocking high ticket prices !!"
"rt had a bit of luck yes, but weathered the storm. gutsy, solid. australian blonks if you don’t applaud watto #cwc15 #ausvpak"
well done shane - made the most of the dropped catch. now get us home. #ausvpak
hasn't been easy which is good will do us a world of good having to fight hard...
50 needed now... #ausvpak
what the fuck was maxwell doing there!!! #ausvpak #cwc15” thought he was at #indianwells ??
that sigh you just heard was aaron finch !! #ausvpak
"yep, thou won't be like that for much longer..."
shot shane... he's now looking good !!
shot watto !! #ausvspak
wonderful half century by steve smith in really good form #ausvpak
australia past the half way mark now... watson seems to have got thru a really tough period... #ausvpak
essendon celebrating like they got the 4 points...oh wait #nabchallenge
so that went well. #nabchallenge” social media lesson 1 - don't make outrageous statements ... lol
"if melbourne can't beat this essendon team, i'm probably going to give the sport away. #nabchallenge” glad you said probably"
it good when there is a real battle between bat and ball...
dropped !! #ausvpak
"there are 22,999,999 aussies behind you watto ... #ausvpak"
it's only third time since 1955 that there won't be a german f1 gp.
ohhhhh nooooooo davey 😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎 #cwc15
not good there...
"not sure if you read but there is no german f1 gp this year, it was cancelled overnite."
"clarke and warner opening with bailey in the middle order is better than finch opening.” yep, finch out of form..."
rt finch lbw. he refers it... one of the worst referrals ever. unless he thought it was the 18th century &amp; middle stumps had…
smith looking in great form...wonderful cover drive #ausvpak
that's out !! poor review... #ausvpak
"so schedule would be 2 friday, 5 sat then 2 sun."
this is not looking good...lol
"there has only ever been one game friday evening, what i'm suggesting is that there should be two."
"no, on a friday nite..."
so start one game at 5.30pm and the next game have it ready to go players on the field as 5 mins left.
your tv or you need new eyes
q: for afl fans - tonite there are 2 games on #nabchallenge - into season proper why can't this done. would you go if game started at 6pm?
geez pies make ur mind on seedsman...
need something. but the main issue is that sa is not developing our own state born players...
didn't know you were playing for dees :p
we need 11 players might be a start...
ohhh and plus the $8 booking fee to print your own ticket !!
australia probably chasing around 220 to reach #cwc15 semi-finals #ausvpak
that's why so many vacant seats. best seats $150 😱😱😱
no. didn't go ticket pricing silly. cheapest was $70 half decent seat $90...
"rt vfl intra club on now at the westpac oval, plenty of afl stars on show. witts, seedsman, reid, freeman &amp; more. come down plen…"
have they announced any teams? link to tweet?
mj dropped caught &amp; bowled only error i can recall.. (ohhh and the 4 overthrows)
it's an internal game right ?
saca should grab him asap...
"rt sohail hammers hazlewood about 90 yards. unfortunately, 45 of them were straight up, and 45 straight down again. haddin t…"
terrible batting by pakistan - they are going to get bowled here. 200 should be easy target for australia #ausvpak
"australia right on top here, 2 slips in place during the 44th over. #ausvpak"
saw a tweet around lunch time that shipperd was gone
big chance now for aussies to bowl pakistan out before the 50th over !! and i type that's out and 8 down... #ausvpak
yes very well glenn. not long now. actually looking fwd to seeing how our young side develops
batting pp of 2.21 runs / over ain't going to win pakistan this match. #ausvpak
india have not beaten australia all summer have they?
anyone want two kids ive had enough for today” gumtree is yr best friend...lol
any access for the final ah or you have to buy a ticket?
"australia do look really pumped for this match, fielding has been top class so far #ausvpak"
couldn't carry watto bags
without any doubt.
reckon watto must have dived at least 3 metres to catch it
ohhh right frost will get elevated to senior list. yes that makes sense... ta
"right yes that's it... so corey will get one spot, who might get the other ?"
"craig still coming to terms with it, it was that good !!"
the old girl still looks good...
don't tell him watto took a great catch !!
"if melbourne can't beat this essendon team, i'm probably going to give the sport away. #nabchallenge” you'll be missed !!"
i guessing hunter is the bulldogs player???
but that's out !! pakistan now in a spot of trouble. #ausvpak
"bookies spot fixing ""haddin flicks off bail and appeals for hit wicket"" 750/1 !!"
i thought it might be out as well...
not out...
don't we have 2 spots available?
just curious that's all.
i should be capt !!
i have an iq2 stb before it was changed to iqhd - how can tell how old it is?
time to bowl maxwell i reckon... #ausvpak
can a regular subscriber order one of the new iq3 stb ?
excellent first 10 overs by australia - now to keep the pressure on. #ausvpak
"i thought it was ""... i can't see us winning a game all year"" lolz"
and that's to use my paper and my ink !!!
ohhh and don't forget the $8 booking fee !!
i really wanted to go but the prices just put me off. a good seat should be $50-$55 not $90.
the nose bleed seats are $70
"bookies spot fixing ""hits bail but won't drop"" 500/1 !! #ausvpak"
rt bail is obviously glued on. bloody bookies. #ausvpak
the zinger bail even lite up but didn't drop !! #ausvpak
and that's not for best seats - the good seats are $150
please tweet the third wicket soon...lol
"it should read ""top"" not ""too"" lol"
one brings two... #cwc15 #ausvpak” not bad even for you leachy !!
gone !!! that's two down #goaussies #ausvpak
i have home game access (3 game m/ship) so there are 11 to choose from. but needs to fit in with work etc.
too catch watto !! #ausvpak
i wanted to go and would have paid $50-$55 for a good seat but not $90
that should be enjoyable. i'm trying to work out now which games i'll come over to melb to watch us play.
let's say you spend $90 and a team gets rolled for 130 game will be over by 6.30pm...
flying up on the day ?
$70 is sit right at back of the stand - sorry that's just too expensive for me.
lower decks were $90 in most stands
you just want to see dayne beams...lol
yep. the eastern stand (normally where members sit) $150
going to brisbane for round 1 ?
check out the riverbank stand top deck it's basically empty and that's the $70 seats...
as the oval is very close to the city many might come after work...

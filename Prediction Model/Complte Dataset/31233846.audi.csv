i swear that they do cute deliberately so that i have to take their photo…
i’ve got one of my cats lying next to me on my desk whilst i work. her gentle snoring is very peaceful and relaxing.
"full refund, no quibbles. well done amazon."
amazon reply - “please explain why you believe the device is counterfeit”. response - “here’s the confirmation email from sandisk”.
the sd card that has been causing issues turns out to be counterfeit and i bought it from amazon! let’s see what they do about it.
"where, where, where??"
four days i’ve had my car and that’s how long it took someone to scratch it. absolute scum.
"pleased i recognised my answer and to be featured. thanks for that, had me reminiscing whilst cooking dinner."
rt the wife of pi.
"only trouble with visiting my mum is she has no mobile phone signal, so dark all day. it’s good though, as i can concentrate on her."
took the new a3 on a trip to see my mum as i can’t get to see her tomorrow for mother’s day. the tech on this audi is ridiculously good.
a3 sportback s-line. it’s my first audi and first new car. in the showroom at the mo picking it up :)
"cab’s just arrived outside, so off we go then. if i wasn’t excited before, i bloody well am now."
"in just over an hour, i will be behind the wheel of a shiny new audi. four months to the day since i ordered it. cannot wait!!"
new car day!!!!!!!
so that cortisone shot lasted a total of 10 days. which sucks. last one lasted eight weeks.
rt beautiful work #jeremyclarkson #bbc #topgear
"being a remote worker, these collaboration features are blowing my mind #lync2013"
i was looking forward to the im side of it when it was announced. no idea of the actual power of this system though.
"i got a “am i free to show someone something” message. called him back, shared my desktop to demonstrate. all through lync."
had my first experience of the new lync 2013 collaboration features at work this morning. very impressed indeed!
i don’t really care what the weather’s like tomorrow as i’m just going driving. better be nice sunday though so i can detail the new car.
"sim card has arrived for the car, yes, that’s for the car. bring on the four-wheeled computer!"
"of course, once i pick up my new car tomorrow another countdown can begin. florida in may baby yeah!!"
"so, after a bit of mucking about, my #newcarcountdown now sits at 24hours and 38 minutes :d"
my day has been a constant cycle of being on the phone and then checking the resulting voicemails.
first break of the day and that’s only cos i can’t hold it in any more #loobreak
rt #capricorn's have extremely high tolerance and can take a lot of pressure but once they snap everyone &amp;amp everything fee…
shank of lamb with a nice merlot. not bad for dinner tonight. i worry about the quality of the proposal i’ve got to do afterwards though…
oh yes :d
rt who needs video refs? just find a few more michael oliver's and we'll be alright. best performance by a ref in a long ti…
"the menu looks quite nice though, so let’s see"
"ugh, this hotel is like going back in time. waiting for the disapproving looks with my ipad on the table with the footie on :-)"
"unfortunately, i’m driving to telford and then in a hotel for two nights. suspect my streak this week won’t last a day."
"if you don’t spend your life in near constant physical pain then you probably don’t appreciate a six day respite. trust me, it’s huge!"
this isn’t a dependency or addiction thing. just knowing that i’m recovering and can be pain free from time to time.
plus i’ve only just taken paracetamol rather than the tramadol that i’ve been on for eight months.
"alas, my shoulder flared up again this morning but knowing that there will be times when i don’t need them. warms the soul a lot."
but i didn’t need to take them for that long which is massive for me.
"unfortunately, with the arthritic shoulder and other things, it was never going to be a longer break than that."
six days without painkillers after fifteen months on taking very strong painkillers multiple times a day. felt much better.
i told the cats they were getting roast chicken for dinner tonight. that would explain the four pairs of eyes watching my every movement.
apparently i dared to enter my own bedroom!
"i always love the way that the parents take responsibility for controlling their little miscreants. oh right, my mistake."
i suspect that i may regret booking the 5.30pm showing as it will no doubt be full of screaming little brats.
"ooh, tickets for the new avengers film have just appeared at southend. aaaaaand they’re booked :d"
made it almost a week without taking any painkillers. suspect that streak’s about to end.
"ugh, liverpool’s game is on bt sport this afternoon. thoroughly disappointed with their coverage, so won’t be watching."
oh yes!
"so yeah, avoid superstitch in leigh, essex. patronising, snide little man."
i’m no fan of smoking but i’d rather smell that than the worst halitosis i’ve smelt in a very long time.
"&gt;&gt; and the other local sewing shop she bought it from, deriding the owner for smoking."
&gt;&gt; it was a sewing shop for christ’s sake and it was bloody obvious who we were there for. he had the gall to dismiss her sewing machine &gt;&gt;
"took my wife to buy something from a local shop yesterday. i got so cross as he would insist on talking to me, rather than her &gt;&gt;"
rt this is awesome. don't get too brave behind that computer. the real world will bite you. just be nice..
"in 30 years of wearing glasses, i have never spent that much on a pair of glasses either."
just bought a pair of porsches….. shame they were glasses and not cars!
"of course, the new glasses i like would be the most expensive ones in the shop…"
i remember the days when a midweek laptop failure meant a quiet work week. nowadays it means a bloody busy weekend!
hmmm… new car is still stuck at the port in germany. it had better be here in time for my week off!
it would appear i need to start blocking time out in my diary for actual work.
so the new optician is already doing better than the old one - “would you like a drink sir?”
it takes a special sort of geek to get this and i wear that badge with pride…
my corporate laptop is normally rock solid. last week and this week? not so much :(
why does it always happen when deadlines are approaching fast?
lost half a day to troubleshooting vpn issues today. gave up and told support to schedule it for a rebuild. much quicker in the long run.
"and, as expected, this afternoon has ended in a shot of cortisone to the shoulder…"
"that’s simple, 10 man mythic raiding"
ooh blinking ooh. thanks for that nugget of info!
"indeedly. that does rather amuse me. plus the gold’s on my bank alt account, not my “play” account."
hmmm…. 1.5m gold sitting on my dormant account. the irony being i can’t access it to resub unless i resub
"i took the time to berate when their update was terrible, so only fair i do it when they fix it. thanks for compromising."
"this week’s #modernfamily was absolute genius. for some strange reason, i now want a macbook too…"
"usually i don’t like being woken up at 9.30 on the weekend but, apparently my new car’s been built, so i really didn’t mind!"
rt leonard nimoy (spock) has sadly passed away. i've just found this. it's not exactly a tribute but will raise a smile
"rt wonderful. the jewish story behind spock &amp; the vulcan salute, according to #leonardnimoy (z""l):"
rt the only blue and gold that matter today.
rt i have never seen such a happy elephant! let him appear on your timeline &amp; give someone a smile. happy friday!
"i can vouch for the headset for the same purpose. it can pair with a mobile phone at the same time too, which is very useful."
"two more days, one more night in this hellhole. i cannot wait to get back to civilisation."
i swear i would get through my twitter timeline quicker if i didn’t click on all the cat pictures.
"it’s caused by the phone holder i use in the car, which i won’t need with the new car. got a new screen protector but at £30 it can wait."
new car arrive already!! this crack in the screen protector on my iphone is getting on my nerves.
"so, this morning i’ve discovered what happens when you cancel your alarm’s snooze and oversleep. blind panic!"
"i’m generally indifferent to man city, but aguerro is something special. plus he seems a really guy to boot. what a git!"
"the other problem with being in this craphole of a hotel, nowhere to sit. if i’m ever unlucky to be up this way again, another hotel for me."
"being able to see an identical a3, bar colour, from my classroom window is not helping one bit!"
"if my car went into production on monday, it should be getting the finishing touches tomorrow. either way, it’ll be all done by friday."
"i braved the outside world and tried a chinese takeaway which was recommended. better than the tripe from room service, but barely."
i would. trying to remember if i’ve got enough to get it anyway. but then i am/was a mount whore ;)
several players i regret leaving liverpool. two of them are on the pitch for barca tonight. lucky buggers
"walking back from reception, just about every room has the manc vs barca game on!"
"after 24hrs in this hotel, i can safely say that it is the worst i have stayed in. i’ve got another four nights yet…"
"having drunk from the glass of coke she brought up, i think it’s cross contamination of putrid smelling hand cream."
my room service has arrived. the onion rings are inedible and the lingering smell of the waitress’ perfume is turning my stomach. great.
"and in a first for training courses, i’m studying it whilst it’s actually relevant for me for work. this rarely, if ever, happens."
i’ve also learned that the product i’m studying this week was named after a child’s stuffed toy…
despite my location this week is a good week. my new car is being built!
"for context, i’m in a hotel in the middle of a business park in the north of england."
the hold system for room service advertises their wedding packages. i can’t think of anywhere more depressing to celebrate your nuptials.
"off to crewe i go, in what can only be described as “a spot of rain”. flipping marvellous."
just a shame it’s a whole week away this time. not going away again until the new car arrives. plus it’s the wife’s birthday today…
"bit of lunch, wander around town, then back to the wrong end of the country. i’m on a cloudera training course, which i’m looking forward to"
watching match of the day and i usually have zero sympathy for chelsea. ref got the big decisions wrong yesterday and they got screwed.
"rt for every retweet this gets, pedigree will donate one bowl of dog food to dogs in need! 😊 #tweetforbowls"
"it was a conscious decision to pick an s-tronic a3. in hindsight, given my physical limitations now, it was bloody genius."
the crap journey back from telford this week is causing me so much pain in my arm. one more commute then no more until the new car arrives.
my holiday can not come round fast enough…
so now the wait begins…
and the icing on the cake? pretty sure i’ve got a speeding ticket heading my way.
"five hours for a three hour journey. m6 snarled up, accident on the m25 and then the a127 shut. hateful bloody journey."
the fact that chromecast works in this hotel and not in the other swings my future bookings in their direction.
"after a godawful journey, i have had a success. chromecast works on the hotel wifi so i can watch netflix on a tv instead of my ipad. result"
"(sorry, just got to the hotel)"
have you tried scanning the bar code? still makes me grin!
couldn’t agree more. my brother and i use it to egg each other on from 80 miles away. it’s food database is extensive too.
the integration between those two is pretty incredible. myfitnesspal is the perfect fitness hub!
"with the way my shoulder’s behaving on this drive, my new car can’t come quick enough. did i mention it’s being built next monday?"
"congestion, rain and idiots. perfect recipe for a 200 mile drive. taking a break at the services…"
"judging by the weather outside, wish i’d topped up the rainx on the car. nevermind."
"here we go then. back up to the wrong end of the country. this week, next week and then i shall be taking a breather."
it’s a home hub 3.
"i have, yes. seems a strange problem"
"but, like i mentioned earlier, netflix and other chromecast-enabled apps are fine."
thanks for this. the issue is only when the app is streaming to chromecast. natively on ios or on my appletv over airplay it’s fine.
that’s what i’m doing and have just repeated. no change i’m afraid.
"well, that’s my mum set up with netflix and an apple tv. just had to upgrade her broadband, which cost £4. so, win then."
"thanks for the link, but that’s what i’m doing already. not a chromecast problem as netflix is flawless. just with btsport app."
"18mbps, adsl2, bt broadband"
"no errors, but as soon as the app is transferred to chromecast the quality plummets and is very jerky. netflix is perfect."
moral of the story. switch bt sport app off and have your team score two goals. reason enough not to use the stupid thing!
so we’ve established that crystal palace’s gayle is a dirty cheat.
i’d say it’s reached the point where if you’re not watching on or it’s simply not worth watching.
"nope, switched back to sky’s sd broadcast as streaming via chromecast is giving me a headache it’s so bad."
works great with netflix. bt sport is a different story though.
"checked the chromecast with netflix and it works like a charm. means it must be ‘s app. shame really, but it’s unwatchable."
"so far, streaming via chromecast is far from the advertised hd. also feels like it’s only showing 2 out of every 3 frames."
“far too grumpy to bear around the house” badum-tish!!
p.s. i have a pressure washer and i’m not afraid to use it so naff off.
"yes, my car is filthy and yes, i’m cleaning it. stop giving me odd looks passers by."
weekends are precious enough right now without wasting time on menial tasks.
the other hindrance is that i’m going to have to cancel the cleaners as i won’t be here. which means i’ll have to do it myself.
"eating room service or restaurant food is okay now and again, but every night of the working week? not so much."
going to have to come up with some ways to address this as i’m away a lot for the next few weeks.
"on top of just generally not liking going away for work, my eating healthily has plummeted to boot. normal food from restaurants is tricky."
bloody racket coming from the kitchen. turns out they couldn’t get the lid off…
will get to try out my chromecast properly tonight for palace vs liverpool. not paying bt for hd so will stream it instead for £30!
bother-flipping-ation.
"ugh, seriously? wow’s the only game i’ve ever been able to play without motion sickness :("
this afternoon should be fun as it appears i have a sinus headache brewing. my poor broken body could do with an mot and a service!
i do appreciate it when people use hashtags for series of tweets. makes it much easier to avoid spoilers or stuff i don’t want to see.
thanks to work i was forced to brave the card shop on the day before valentine’s day. just ridiculous.
can’t be bothered to find a restaurant tonight so room service ordered. let’s see how that stacks up to my usual hotel.
quite like the hotel i’m in and notice the tv has hdmi and usb. chromecast ordered so i can watch netflix on the tv instead of my ipad!
&lt;&lt; this has got you written all over it ;)
"had nerve conduction test today on my radial nerve. given the intense pain, i’m going to go out on a limb and say that there is a problem"
"not that i intend to watch it tonight, i’ve got the second episode of better call saul on netflix!!"
i have also completed my public service of sorting the picture on the hotel room tv. why are they always horrendous…
and i’m here. always love to discover main motorways shut on my route…
"righty then, off i go. just need to pick some cd’s for the car (won’t miss that either!!)"
"plus, of course, the integral quality of driving everywhere in a nice new audi. it will make these trips more bearable."
"so much easier than watching the speedo and the road. set and forget, i like that."
"now foot a three to four hour drive, depending on traffic. wish i had my adaptive cruise control for the speed traps already…"
it’s the little things…
"rather than pack the suit holder and suitcase, this trip i’m just using an overnight bag and i’m amazed it all fits."
"we’re up to the hospital part of the day, which hurt like hell. must be nap time now, before the interminable drive north."
jinxed it!!
please tell me you bumped his table and knocked his coffee over…
"pills, work, hospital, pills, nap, drive to telford, collapse. my day today…"
starting the day in pain does not bode well for my mood today.
"okay, so turns out this cold i thought i was getting rid of has a sting in the tail. just in time for a trip to the wrong end of the country"
imdb lies!!! it’s available from tomorrow!!
to the wife “i’ll be up after i’ve watched the first episode of better call saul.” takes ipad to bed to watch the second one…
this is what you get to put up with when your body falls apart. at 37…
it always fricking hurts though as it involves elbows and thumbs in very sore pressure points.
the masochist in me is strangely looking forward to my chiropractor session. getting rid of the pain down my arm would be nice.
"in their words: what a mythic disappointment. &lt;&lt; day made, i’m in a blog post :d"
second gig back and first public one tonight. wrist felt even better. feels incredible to be back on the stage with total80s.
i’m kicking myself that i didn’t start this years ago. could have saved some serious dosh.
plus it was money i was going to be spending anyway. can’t grumble at the returns from it. maybe nyc in september will be back on!
one free companion ticket plus enough air miles for two return flights to nyc 5 months. getting this credit card was a stroke of genius!
"90%+ of my browsing is ios based, which is why mobile compatibility is so important."
yep
packing up for tonight’s gig. it’s not that i really like gear or anything…
i’m on windows but pleased to see something’s in the works to get rid of the “oh not that again” groan (totally understand btw)
hey guys. have you considered writing an app that sits in the system tray so i don’t have to refresh my location every few days?
"reading ‘s blog made me need to write about my own raiding experiences. it was just a comment, but it felt quite cathartic."
you really got me thinking and 140chars wasn’t enough. just added a comment - almost a blog post in its own right
this blog post resonates so much with me. i’m an ex-10man heroic raider and really feel blizzard messed up with mythic.
just checked my virgin atlantic flying club account and have qualified for a free companion flight. time to plan another holiday!
i discovered a sublime pizza last night - papa john’s pulled pork pizza. that was quite the welcome surprise.
three months today and we’ll be flying off to florida. i cannot wait!
"lovely dinner prepared, cooked and consumed. now to endure a sewing show on tv cos the wife’s “not well”."
time to brave that outside place and get something for dinner. fresh pasta tonight i think.
ditto. i get the same snide comments. i’m more productive at home than in an office by miles!
hmmm… maybe polishing off half a bag of dried prunes wasn’t a brilliant idea
our little corner of the world does appear to be meteorologically mental this afternoon!
"rt ""i told you both of us could fit."" ""i fucking hate you right now."""
the wife and i watched the return of #greysanatomy tonight. swear there was a dalek in with all the scans!
thanks and likewise. i’m on a permanent preventer but think it’ll be a trip to the docs for some proper steroids tomorrow.

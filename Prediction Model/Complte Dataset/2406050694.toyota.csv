rt worrying is a waste of time. it doesn't change anything. it messes with your mind and steals your happiness.
"rt people don't change, they reveal who they really are."
"rt people born in 1997-1999 have lived in three decades, two centuries, and two millenniums and they are not even 18 yet!"
after not having a bad dream for over a year and then all of a sudden start having one every single night. not liking this at all
i really need to get up for work
as long as you are being yourself you aren't doing anything wrong. so always be you not what other people want you too be.

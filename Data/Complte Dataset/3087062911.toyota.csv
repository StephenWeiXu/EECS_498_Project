"loving it! god is to good to me. i am deeply blessed. also i am back into taking pictures again. my favorites are animals, clouds, people."
"i am so happy right now. i am now doing the things that i love to do! such as dancing, walking, singing, helping people who are in need."
"i have decided to go without medical insurance, my medications, and not seeing any drs. just can't afford it right now."
i have 2 incurable diseases for which there is no cure. that being said i am not afraid of being very poor or death.
and what about people who are poor and in need?
i have been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's and i also have adhesion disease wrapped around my intestines. no cure.
just wanted to let you know that i had to cancel my membership and no one ever thought to pray for me.
living on sad is extremely difficult i am very great full for at least having a roof over my head. can't afford much else. thx
stadium toyota told me it would cost me over 5k. i know someday i will have a new one. i still can dream
i love to wish a lot. i have a 2003 toyota echo. one of the best saving gas vehicles ever made.
"looks delicious, but unfortunately i am allergic to mangos."
amen!
"i will never ever due business with star farm ins again. they are charging me $150 per month, though i am on a fixed income."
i'm not worried. i have 2 incurable diseases. don't know which one will kill me first but i am not afraid anymore.
wanted to let you folks know of an idea i had emailed to someone there. apparently whoever it was took it and i saw my idea!
i am somehow going to get myself out of my financial situation. i know in my heart that god in his infinite mercy will get me thru this!
"i thank god i still have a paypal account. i am currently in the negative, but i will not be for long i hope."

i have just decided to do without. please pray for me
"which now leaves me without my meds,dr's, gas for car, laundry and food. life is hard but i will just have to endure it ."
"i have just added up all of my bill's for this month and it comes out to be $1,264.13 and my disability is for only $1,047.00,"
"no. i have no choice anymore. sorry, but i am going back to citrus park in tampa and cancelling all of this. bill me the $1k.ok"
"i have tried, nothing is working. i have no choice but to cancel everything"
life is extremely difficult for me right now being diagnosed with adhesions and early onset alzheimer's. i don't have much.
thank you for never replying to any of my complaints.
"after i pay prudential back, then they will send me the rest of my checks due me. however i get a check from prudential with a zero amount."
prudential long term disability wrote me a letter indicating that they over paid me 5k and i need to pay that back.
to cancel my verizon wireless network would cost me $1000.00 to cancel. this is not fair. i am on disability with a fixed income.
went to verizon today and was convinced to keep what i have but this agent i spoke with added more costs to my account monthly.
i am so over whelmed with so many bills that i will stop all my meds can't afford it anymore and not able to see any of my doctors.
what is a dm?
"i can't deal with this stress anymore. i am sorry, but i don't want to end up in the hospital again with a bleeding ulcer."
i am turning in my phone in and also my jetpack tomorrow. just can't be burden with this anymore. i have an incurable diseases.
i just can't believe i will be 54 this coming october. i want so desperately to help others who have both of my incurable illnesses.
"which is what i may have to do, bit now till it gives out on me which is coming very soon."
this rate i will not be able to afford anymore and one of your agents gabe me advice ad to just get rid of the car.
"i am now on disability and i only have an income of $1047.00 per month, which is not much to live on. my rate is $150 per month."
but it is the only car i have left to get around in until it can't be used anymore. just can't afford to get it fixed.
they all knew that i didn't have that kind of money plus they also knew i was on disability. i know my car won't last much longer.
so with my neighbor who is in a wheelchair sat in my car watching the whole thing. they want me trade my old car in for a new one.
plus the service director of stadium toyota in tampa all made me feel inadequate and stupid. they knew i didn't have the money.
"be that said the last and final time i took my car to be looked at, that i should get rid of it and the mechanic,service manager"
"i have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on my echo, but now i can't work any more due to critical health issues."
i am looking forward to have my disability check this wednesday so that i can pay some of my bills. most importantly having a roof over me.
my knees are really hurting bad today. i can't afford to go see a doctor for a while due to my financial situation. i'll just have to wait.
today i was able to help my next door neighbors out who are both in wheel chairs. i managed to clean their kitchen and closet. i enjoy it!
love it!
i have decided to give all of my overwhelming loads of bills over to the lord.
"can't afford to live in a beautiful home, because of being on social security disability checks each month."
amen!
unfortunately i am living on as disability monthly because i have two diseases for which there is no cure.
"just can't afford much of anything anymore, with that said. i will be turning my phone back in to store in citrus park"
unfortunately i won't be able to enjoy my droid anymore because of my illnesses and receiving disability income.

i am not afraid of death because i have been close to it many times in the past and it is very peaceful. jesus will be with me always.
"i don't know which diseases will kill me first, but i know that when i do die, i will be with my lord and my children i lost."
"i am so very blessed with all that god has given to me, especially my salvation thru jesus christ. he has been there with me all of my life."
living on disability doesn't help much when it is all you have to live on. i worry all the time about if i am going to make it this month.
"when i saw the movie called still alice with julianne moore i had to leave in middle of the movie, because i have the same disease."
now that i have been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's. i will ask my neurologist to be lobotomized this week on my doctors visit.
"i saw part of the movie ""still alice"" and had to leave because i have been diagnosed with early onset alzheimer's ."

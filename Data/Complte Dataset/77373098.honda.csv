lo mas importante es lo que pase ahora
"since we got atletico in the draw, it's only right to rock this today. #ladecima #halamadrid…"
"isco, morata and dani are with the first team. there's some good news ☺️"
and real getting atletico in the draw isn't any better either

well now he's really proving himself
where the boos at now?!!! yessss bale!!! #halamadrid
ronaldo wants to win so bad. if only everybody else on the team was like him
bale's desperate to stop the boos
for the next 90 minutes i will only have raging anxiety.
these lineup changes better make a difference. i would die if this goes to 4 games. #halamadrid
ramos is back! yaaaaasssss #halamadridynadamas
easter gives me anxiety for one reason. rabbits are my worst fear and i have no idea why
damn. nicky jam is all over the radio
can't get the feeling of driving that honda out of my head. i think i'm in love
only one day stands in between me and getting my new car. patience is definitely not my friend right now
hopefully this is the last day i'm driving the mazda! *fingers crossed*
it's one of these kind of nights.
"rt welcome home,"
rt i can't stop laughing at this 😂😂

they didn't deserve to move on. and i love those guys more than anything
that cameraman is lucky he didn't die
"yo. schalke just score, real doesn't deserve to move on"
real doesn't deserve anything happy anymore
is anyone else noticing how frustrated ronaldo is today?! he's really the only one who cares #halamadrid #ucl

this is so frustrating. it's like they don't even care
and the heart is here. good subs

i don't care about anything right now except for revis and real madrid. the life of a sports fan/sports journalism major
rt grande cr7 .vamos real.
rt this is what scoring in the #ucl means to

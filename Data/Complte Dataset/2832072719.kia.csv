i wonder if anita ever suspected that she'd become a caricature of herself
well...if i werent in school for *animation*
i know that feel. if i weren't in school. i'd play the more time consuming games
been playing both ror and ftl. some of the best games that i play casually

"fuck, what else am i suppose to decorate with? .... .... fuck you mean, ""use drapes?"""
#notyourshield is something i see existing far beyond #gamergate. it's a strong concept. because ppl exploit us often
put an umbrella on dat light! :p
lol these ppl wouldn't last a minute out of their privileged bubble.
"taking from patton oswalt words, im glad these racists are finally outing themselves. lol"
rt omg!... a new season of #gamergate!!!

"yea. and as long as those ppl r around it gets hard for ppl to just ""drop the whole race crap"" i try evry time"
"there's an underground dungeon full of dank memes, somewhere. let's hope they don't ever find the dank dungeon"

unfortunately there r a lot of ppl still alive that think different race/genes actually mean diff type of person
nice! cant wait to see!
rt #coms3200s15 so i heard you journos want to hear what #gamergate is. here you go. there is no lose. ht‚Ä¶
rt #coms3200s15 the people of gg are people the media blackout that they have received is immoral
ah ok. i suggest u try and get one character in there as a test b4 u make all the other ones! #advicefox :) gl!
u planning on using unreal4?
"also they couldnt use minorities as a shield, cuz what's a minority in a global setting?"
"u cant talk about the world, cuz they'll have to include their class privilege. feminists will never do that"
"i know every single one of those characters, wut? is this a real life article?"
"randi ""sektie"" harper trying to delete old tweets. you cant erase your past, sektie..def not your past #gamergate"
rt randi harper deleted the tweet where she claims she was the cause of my suspension. don't know how to feel about that ‚Ä¶

"tb, am i also stupid because some people on kia did something u dont like? i use kia... are we hivemind now?"
oh i see what happened. nvm lol

"with chans, if u see something u don't agree with, you have to say something otherwise it will go unchallenged."
i seriously hate to see my shit get negative points...like..say what you didn't like about it.

"hey #gamergate ....twitter sucks on my phone, anything happening today?"
i c wat u did there
"rt ""female game devs are being silenced!"" #letdevsspeak happens. ""nobody is silencing devs, idiots."" at least try to get you‚Ä¶"
rt i can see why feminists got firefox to ban the extension that replaces words like men with jews #gamergate
rt i see a lot of people denouncing shitposting. keep in mind that #gamergate's trending power comes from shitposters.
lol alright enuff fucking around lol. back to animating :p

"pls untag, ive done my job as advicefox"

weak people justify they're shitty actions. at least a strong person can just admit to wanting to be an asshole. i can at least respect that
have a good one
alright. i said what i need to say. i hope u were open minded enuff to hear me out.
that's weak rationalization and justification of your actions.
"im guessing ur feminist, correct?"
no im looking at you tell a stranger to give themself a bleach enema on some moral high horse
it's disingenuous to compare mra's to hategroups like the kkk.
"[btw im not an mra, but my point is still the same]"
which means you might not have even given mra's a chance to make their case. can u honestly say u have?
the def of bigotry is closemindedness to other opinions/perspectives
"and whats worse is, you think ur moral high ground gives u a platform to say hateful shit. welcome to westboro"
nah. the definition of bigotry. it's literally the definition. look it up. lol
rt to be clear. my baby is going to be a girl im going to have a little girl :d
"man...twitter brings out the worst in ppl, dude."
so because someone thinks differently than u it warrants that kind of vitriol? isn't that called bigotry?
rt let me remind you that the whole crime of is to dislike a blind blockbot.
so sam harris is one. therefore ur telling steve pinker to give himself a bleach enema?
and illegal too
mra? who said they were one?
what the fuck is wrong with u?
rt criminal sentencing: do women get off easy?: via
rt gamergate refference? no! its from the 80s when media were after dungeons and dragons.
do they at least give you hot pockets?
i...i didnt say anything...
tfw is following you
"rt check out our interview with jon festinger, q.c. ‚Äúvideo game censorship and freedom of speech‚Äù via htt‚Ä¶"
alright. anyways. it's almost time for me to go to work and such. have a good morning/night/whatever!
"like.i get that it's not popular to say,but i hope to god, ppl don't start forcing me to raise my future kids to be sjws lol"
hypothetical future kid what their gender is rather than let them decide for themself...like...for real
honestly i think i couldn't care less about what a person decides they want to be. my ex gave me shit cuz i said i'd tell my
"i take it, they think it's an aggressive misdefinition or something."
ahhh i see now.
srry. i thought i did. lol
really? im so new with this trans stuff
tru tru. i mean.i happen to think the dick refers them back to the male role :p but i know thats not pop to say these days
ohhh the trap creed
im totally str8 but we have fun here :)
"interesting. i guess some might find traps offensive, or enjoyable as well :p"
"been sayin it for a while, but not even sure if im pissin' ppl off. didn't say it in front of my ex's friends tho"
is trap an offensive word btw? im new at these buzzwords
who can't resist a good trap.
"i didn't even think about that. u practically must be sjw before u can even apply for a les card, huh?"
it takes into account those that don't conform to that whole gender binary schpiel. they are considered in-between
but i realized how toxic it was being amongst her and all her many friends. it seriously was toxic
"but yea, i agree. i dated an sjw...pretty much as the term was becoming more popular. it scared me shitless haha"
i thought pansexual was the in-thing now? jk
i just want to be seen for who i am.that's an actual goal of mine. to find someone who doesn't see a blk guy first
it gets tiring after the millionth time
and have to make the decision if it's my job to sit there and explain some things to him or if it's even my job to
just the other day i had to deal with something that was like...well fuck...i think my good friend is racist.
but yea. i can't stand this race to be the most oppressed minority. like..shit is not fun.
they were definitely contrasty.
but there have been a lot of history that the us won't ever teach. cuz it's some fucked up shit. since colombus
which i personally had different opinions on dif things he's said
mx was quite a formidable dude. he fucken destroyed in debates. regardless of whether u agree with him or not
welp. i hope this doesn't become an oppression olympics. lol
and only talk about martin luther king. because at the time malcom x scared the shit out of them. lol
yea. the story of ppl like malcom x is kinda like that for me a lil bit. american schools try to blot him out
"i'll def look it up, thanks. im into history"
"it's just bullshit. i wish for one day, ppl could see past this. one day."
not a day goes by that some statistic gets used about black on black crime 2 justify our lessernes
is always at each others throats about how their race is somehow special or more superior or something...
u see...this is the problem i see. everyone's got their own tragedies. u know..but everyone is[c]
"im right with ya there. im too black to be hispanic, and too hispanic to be black"
i read that as irish coffee ships. at first. lol nope i didnt
tho most times i brush it off as the ignorant shit it is.
"as if my genes somehow make me a more violent person, or more prone to do this, or that. its fucken annoying"
its...tough...i can agree with that. but all my life i get ppl try to tell me who i am cuz of my skin.
but like..he's not hateful towards gay ppl. he's just slightly grossed out. he's not gonna go westboro on em
"i mean...my dad grew up being pretty homophobic, there's no changin' him now. he's pretty set in his ways"
lol racist in a broad sense. haha idk what that means lol but i like it
most times i don't get mad at old racist ppl cuz like...i understand theres ignorance there
"alot of ppl live on ""well at least im not black"" they may not be racist, but..i mean...yea"
i grew up black/hispanic. and white latinos do whatever they can to not be brown its fuckin hilarious
its weird. cuz there are so many ethnic groups that use blacks to make themselves feel better abt themselves
"yea fair. they also hated italians too, right?"
the term minority works in a local sense. but globally? not really
ironically the irish have had a shitty time with racism. yet they still were plenty racist too towards blacks
i hear that. the problem is that arthur is thinking america is the only place that exists.
lol what is the strictest sense of the word? lol
"arthur chu, needs to just fuck off with his racist ass opinions. this isn't some coveted status."
why does everyone seem to want to be a minority? being black hasn't gotten me super far...except for when i run.
this animation is fucking me in the ass. i can't get this rig to do anything i want it to.
"their goal, if they can call us a hate group enough, no one will feel the need to validate the call for integrity in media"
"so they keep confusing the situation,claiming harassment despite the fact that we've been making them update ethics policies"
"the media uses three women who claim harassment as a shield 4 criticism against them,cuz if they didn't they'd have 2 fess up"
"we roll with it, cuz the hashtag allows us to share info pretty fast. also we were forced into twitter by other shitty sites"
relationship while doing so. anyways.gamergate is the label put on a grp of ppl that seek out ethical breaches in games media
"saying we're misogynist, because its a buzzword. they don't even realize they trampled over a poor guy in an abusive [c]"
for years the gaming media has had it in with gamers.when called out 4 being corrupt they turned it around on us [c]
"gg seems a little quieter these days, but here we are trying to #letdevsspeak so i'm okay with that. it's their turn now."

gay culture just keeps thrusting itself into gamergate.

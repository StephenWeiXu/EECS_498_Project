"""oh right,"" he hadn't felt this embarrassed in a while. they reached the house when night was truly upon them."
"--weirdo. especially not by you."""
"""okay i definitely wasn't farting. i honestly don't know why i said that. i was facepalming okay? i don't wanna be seem as a--"
"""n-no.. i don't fart. particularly in front of such a beautiful lady."""
"""b-but.. my laces.. fine i was farting.. you happy now?"" ..farting.. really? he might as well have told the truth."
"""huh.. yeah.. i was just err... tying my shoe laces."" he hadn't needed to tie his laces since he first bought those shoes."
he intentionally fell behind slightly letting her walk ahead so that he could silently facepalm without her seeing. stupid rico.
"""ummm.."" was all he could say in response to her look. ""it was a gesture of... comforting you after you missed the altaria?"""
--doing he merely turned it into a pat on the back and returned his arms to his sides. phew.
"""sure."" as they turned back he instinctively raised his arm around her back poised to hold her but once realising what he was--"
"""heh. sounds good to me."" this got him excited as he loved driving fast. especially in his jeep."
"""i'd drive slower than usual so you could sleep in the jeep again. i don't mind."""
"--the day after tomorrow. heh."""
"""well the drive is gonna take hours depending on traffic. we could leave whenever you're ready. the beach will still be there--"
"--conditioning in my jeep."""
"""you should pack when we get back. we'll leave first thing in the morning. gallade's currently looking at fixing the air--"
"""i can do tomorrow. it would be good to see my home region again. it's been a while."""
"""well whenever you're ready to leave i could take you to hoenn. whether it's tomorrow, next week, next year.. i'll take ya."""
"""tanning? not my thing. i could talk you one day though.."" he paused to nervously look at her. ""...perhaps?"""
"""too hot? that's where all the babe-.. i mean... the slateport beach is a nice place to visit if you haven't been already."""
"--i was born in hoenn and started off over there."""
"""indeed it is. except.."" he was going to tell her that he was a millionaire after doing it for so long but he stopped. ""except--"
"""..i don't make a money from chauffeuring people around. that's a hobby. i'm a poacher. and have been since i was a kid."""
"""i bet he does."" memories of being trampled by suki's very jolly scolipede were brought to him."
"""sounds like a familiar game plan. how long have you been doing it for?"""
"he took it upon himself to change the subject. ""so you go hunting? what do you hunt? or what have you hunted?"""
"there was no altaria. ""oh. it must've flown into the clouds. it's quite dark."" a miracle? it's a good thing rico is an optimist."
"with a millisecond of catching her suspicious glance he turned his attention back to the clouds again. ""oh look, an altaria."""
"""so err"" hesitating before speaking again, he scratched the back of his head. ""what would it take for you to accept another man?"""
"""now that does sound exhausting. sounds like a bitch to me. no offence."""
"""oh yeah? well then it's no surprise you guys aren't together. what happened?"""
"""tell me about it."" he gathered from her answer that she was single. ""have you ever had a boyfriend?"""
"""so err.."" slowly his gaze would lower to land in line with her eyes. ""how goes your ability to hold down a man?"""
"he faced the sky after feeling a tad flustered and said, ""it might be.."""
"""that's why i live alone. far from any drama whatsoever. and also because i haven't been able to hold down a girlfriend."""
"""6 siblings?! dayum your parents got busy. well it's no wonder you live on your own away from them. are we in unova right now?"""
"""if there be one fool to listen to a story then it is in fact interesting,"" he replied while looking at her with a small smirk."
"the bulky man let the door shut on itself as before catching up with suki eventually walking beside her. ""so what's your story?"""
"""you got the keys?"" he asked while still standing at the door."
"rico walked towards her front door and held it open for her. ""after you."""
"the loading of a gun could be heard in the distance as the poacher muttered to himself. ""loud mothersucker."""
"""good. now, do you wanna go for a walk or nah?"""
"""and i certainly haven't cooked dinner for anyone."""
"""plus i've never actually taken someone to their home. especially after leaving my jeep in the middle of nowhere to do so."""
"""if it makes you feel better, i'm only your tour guide."""
"""i go for drives in my jeep and offer people lifts if they need it. just like yourself."""
"""no wonder you live in the mountains. it's the perfect spot for quiet walks."""
"""hopefully they'll keep out of his way. so aside from sleeping and the occasional hunting, what do you like doing?"""
"""thank you. and would you mind if i let my pokemon sleep out in the yard with scolipede? tyranitar, fearow and gallade?"""
"""would you mind if i helped myself to a glass of rum?"""
"""sounds lovely. thank you."" he nodded at her appreciatively. ""what've you got to drink?"""
"""so then where do i sleep?"" he asked looking around. ""not that i have a problem with out in the yard with scolipede or anything."""
"""because you're a very intriguing woman."" it was true. he couldn't tell her that he was crushing on her. not yet."
"""and what if i said i'd stay cos i wanna spend more time with you?"" the expression on his face was honest and serious."
"""if i stayed it would only be because i'd miss scolipede. the trampling was really err... soothing?"""
"""oh right,"" was rico's casual response. he knew she wanted him to stay. ""perhaps i could err... keep you company for the night?"""
"was this leading to where he thought it was? an invitation to sleep on her swingset? ""i don't. why do you ask?"""
"--hospitality any more than i have done already."""
"he was fist pumping inside when all he did was give a short nod. ""i better get going, miss. i wouldn't want to abuse your--"
"""that minako looks familiar. can't put my finger on where from though.."""
"""don't mention it. it's the first of many, i expect. wouldn't you think so?"" he raised his eyebrows wondering what she'd say."
"""it's alright mate."""
"""i'm not a pirate."""
"""nevermind then. i'll leave you my number. contact me if you need anything."""
"""see. over here."""
"""you told me. a while back."""
"""alright. the name's rico by the way. i'm not usually honest with my occupation but i'll make you an exception. i'm a poacher."""
"""alright. so there's nothing i can do for you?"""
"""i know. i was joking mate. is there anything you need? i know your condition and would be happy to bring you anything you need"""
"""dafuq do you want?"""
"""that candy's always fucking talking."""
"did she actually grin back? it certainly looked like a grin! ""i'm glad you liked it suki."""
"the bulky male smiled at her words. ""provided that your food back home was more than satisfactory i'd be happy with that!"""
"""is it now?"" he smiled at her brief feedback on his rico's cooking."
"--beans and roast potatoes. ""dinner is served."""
"""so you really do love to sleep."" he was in the doorway before walking in to give her a plate with lamb shanks, boiled carrots--"
"a good 30 minutes later she would hear his call from the kitchen. ""dinner's ready, mate. you got a dining room or nah?"""
"""got it. you just chillax. leave the food to me."""
"""alright. so where's your kitchen? and what's in the fridge?"""
"""ah. well then let me cook you something. i'll make you dinner."""
"--how about i make you a nice cup of tea or coffee?"""
"he felt bad for faking his little act now. frowning slightly, he followed her back into the house. ""let me make it up to you. --"
"""i guess i'd deserve it!"" he admitted while getting to his feet dusting his clothing with his hands."
"he looked up at scolipede's expression and put an apologetic arm up. ""sorry bruh. i was just messing."""
"this... he did not expect. he pulled away after a few seconds gasping for breath. ""dammit woman! what if i was dead!"""
he did his best to keep a straight face as she patted his face and shook him but wasn't giving anything away.
-mouth to mouth resuscitation.
his eyes were closed but he had definitely regained consciousness although he showed no sign of it. he was hoping for a--
"as the scolipede shifted off of him, rico just lay on the ground on the same spot with circular unconscious eyes."
--were his hands from his outstretched arms on either side from her pokemon's body.
"the scolipede bundles rico over knocking him to the ground like a bowling skittle. ""ooof!"" all that could be seen of him now--"
"""oh sh-.."" was what he said as he was immobilised by the huge scolipede heaving itself towards them."
rico fully stepped out i to the backyard and looked around for the pokemon.
"""is that so?"" struggling to see how being friendly can be bad, the poacher was eager to meet him walking towards the backyard."
"""i see. and how does he take to strangers?"""
"""yeah. where dafuq is he?"""
"""to be fair not all girls are the same. some can be fun to be around."""
"""oh right."" rico's head was constantly turning while he was clueless as to where such a big pokemon could be hiding."
"""tell me about it, mate."""
"""oh. thanks."" the male poacher followed her into the house. ""so do you live with anyone?"""
"""well it looks cosy."" he was being honest. ""nice spot. great atmosphere."""
"""i hear that."" he was behind her all the way not helping but enjoying the view ahead of him. heh."
"shaking his head at her sarcastic remark he followed. ""i can use gallade to clear the path if you need him to."""
"""i would offer to carry you on my back but one would think you'd be used to the trip by now!"""
"""i don't even do it in my house so don't worry about that,"" he revealed honestly. ""how far to your place from here?"""
"""i tend to smoke on the rare occasion. for instance, when i'm in the middle of nowhere and don't know what dafuq to do. heh."""
"""by the way, what are your thoughts on smoking?"" he nervously tucked the cigar pack deeper into his pocket."
"""didn't wanna wake you up so i let you rest. i had my eyes on the jeep making sure you were safe though, don't worry."""
--fumes before making his way over to her.
"after hearing the jeep door open he would put out his cigar, not to hide it but so she wouldn't breathe any of its unhealthy--"
--he stepped out of the vehicle and began smirking a cigar about thirty yards away from the jeep so as not to disturb her.
after about thirty minutes of driving at a calm pace they had reached the end of the valley. he was reluctant to wake her up so--
-beautiful she looked when she was asleep.
the road towards valley was clear from any obstruction. rico took the chance to look at her. words couldn't describe how--
"""nowhere whatsoever? where have you been keeping shelter until now?"""
"""where to?"""
"""good."" he rolled down both windows as the air conditioning in the jeep still wasn't working."
"""taste good?"""
"""there's a bottle of water in there too."" the jeep was now well on its way down the road."
"he banged open his compartment to reveal some nutrition bars in there. ""help yourself."" the jeep began to take off."
"""don't whimper either."" he closed the door once she got in before he jumped over to the driver's side."
"""why are you coughing?"" he asked harshly. ""don't cough."" he opened the passenger side of his jeep."
"""dafuq was that?"" he asked while walking to his jeep."
"""you look very unhealthy. come with me."""
"his hand raised to her cheek height to rub the dirt off for her. ""how old are you?"""
"""and why would you wanna lay low."" the jeep was going at 40mph as the road ahead was busy with cars with traffic moving okay."
"he pulled her up before examining the surroundings. ""if i'm not mistaken, you look like you're all alone."""
"""where are you heading?"" he asked as the jeep began to move."
"the poacher took a step forwards and held out his hand to help her up. ""my name is rico."""
"""look at me."" he demanded."
"""jump in."" he leaned over to push the passenger door open."
"""nice jacket,"" he said sticking a middle finger up at all the drivers honking at him for holding up traffic. ""need a ride?"""
"""fudge cakes.."" he said while rolling his eyes at the girl."
"""yo."" the jeep slowed down to the walking pace of the young man."
"""dafuq is wrong with you?!"""
"""spit it out."""
"the poacher was in his jeep when he noticed the other male walking along the sidewalk. ""hmm.."""
"""why are you stuttering?"""
"""ahem."""
"""vermilion it is."" the jeep began to move. ""you might wanna put your seatbelt on. i can take this baby pretty fast."""
"""i grew up away from the city. only came here cos that's where all the booty is. double meaning. heh."""
"""i've never been out here before. it's quiet. just how i like it."""
"the poacher would smirk noticing her slight change in tone. his attention to detail was good. ""don't mention it."""
"""i'm feeling fine. i'm just making the ride as pleasurable and relaxing for you as possible."""
"--that she wasn't a fan of seatbelts, he could sense that she wanted a relaxed journey."
"after rico hopped into his seat, the jeep took off but nowhere near to the speed he was driving at as not only did he now know--"
"""got it."" once they'd reached the jeep he held the passenger door open for her once more."
"//*prompted not promoted...// ""heh. you don't have to tell me that twice."" he said walking towards his jeep. ""where to now?"""
"as if he truly believed he was being reasonable he noticed her expression which promoted him to say: ""what?"""
"""fuck it."" he said as if she hadn't said anything at all. ""my jeep can handle anything."""
"""how dafuq am i meant to drive my jeep up into the mountains?"""
"""what if it's cheap?"""
"""or maybe that can wait. i hear you like to sleep also? where do you currently sleep?"""
"""pfft if you say so, miss. anywho... hunting or nah?"""
"""once a month ain't good enough mits"""
"he genuinely chuckled at her response. ""i'm kidding!"""
"""oh..."" he puts on a fake laugh. ""fufufufufufu.."""
"""he doesn't have a phone.. he just swiped these two so we can sell them."""
rico whistled and his gallade appeared at his side holding boxes of two brand new smart phones in each blade.
"""up to no good eh? well guess what?"""
"""...i must be looking pretty badass for you to say i look like a poacher. so you're a hunter? that's pretty hot."""
"""can you now?"" he straightened the gloves on his hands before heading back to his jeep. ""i'll take that as another compliment."""
"""sssshh"" he looked around making sure nobody was eavesdropping before leaning in close to her before whispering, ""i'm a poacher."""
"""well then it looks like your tour of this shopping center is done. i'ma take you hunting."""
"""how about you tell me what interests you and i'll take you there."""
"""yeah let's not go in there. so the next one is the the music, blu-ray and dvd store."""
"""heh. i'll take that as a compliment."" he walked on to the next shop which was a massive supermarket."
"""i was just saying what it was. in all honesty, i prefer a girl with as less make up as possible who is naturally good looking."""
"they passed the beauty shop. ""so this is where ladies go to get the shit that makes their skin glow and smell nice."""
while chuckled lightly he followed her. of course he was hung up on her. he was head over heels over her imperious manner.
"with a slight annoyance in his voice he asked her, ""are you lost miss?"""
"a small smirk would appear on his face as he took the clutch off of park. ""where can i take you, miss?"""
"""pffft.. you wish i was hung up on hanging up with you. i'm just being a proper chauffeur slash tour guide."""
"""so we are. are you in a rush? if not, i could be your tour guide of the department store. i've certainly got time to kill."""
"""nevermind.."" he said with an expression of slight annoyance as the engine of his jeep roared."
"""may i suggest you keep the receipt so you can get a free screen replacement for next time!*"
"""what was wrong with your old phone anyway? before you smashed it that is.."""
"""i'll keep that in mind."" rico turned to the worker. ""dafuq are you looking at bruh?!"""
"""well actually i just wanted to impress you,"" he replied with the worker listening to every word."
"""i know that. i just.. you know.. wanted to show off what i had in my pocket."""
"""just get the fuck outta my face, will ya? you're a sore burn that i just wanna forget, now."""
"""pffft. i got this."" he stepped in front of her and pulled out a wad of cash, took a note out of it and gave it to the worker."
"--sight."""
"he couldn't take any more of her whining. with one last great suck of her neck he let her go. ""now get the fuck out of my--"
"""what can i do? i can do many things. technology is one of them being a poa-.. a part of the field of work i'm involved in."""
"it didn't stop there. his lips moved from hers, down to her chin before sliding down her neck."
"""nice choice. now, how about instead of smashing this one when something goes wrong, you bring it to me to have a look at, eh?"""
--her once more.
"he did the same and when she was out, rico got to her just in time to slam her against his jeep before beginning to kiss--"
"""see any you like there suki? you're scaring this dude half to death."""
"""i know that might be a bit difficult for ya,"" he joked with the member of staff as he gestured towards her phone remnants."
--with silent laughter behind her.
she received a few weird looks from the employees as rico did well to keep his snort as quiet as possible while he cracked up--
"he unclipped her whips and handed them to her. ""try anything funny and gallade will be onto you."""
"""it's an expression.."" he said as they reached the phone store. ""do you know what you're getting or nah?"""
"gallade cut her loose once more. ""out you go. and i never wanna see your face again."""
"""you look lost. let me lead. and btw keep your cash in your pocket. i'll sort you out."" he walked ahead of the young woman."
"""sounds good to me."" he stamped his foot down on the brakes as the jeep came to a halt with a heavy jolt."
"""you make a fair point. how about we come to an agreement?"""
"with great effort, he quickened his strides to best her to the doors only to hold them open for her and bowed his head slightly."

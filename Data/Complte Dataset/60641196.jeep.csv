"man, this new yak looks bad to the bone and perfect design for marshes here in louisiana."
players are fine with latest cba deal then. do not come crying later.
"new jeep wrangler ( gecko pearl ). his name is ""monster"" my camping &amp; kayak fishing hauler."
great article. this is one hard-nosed player we can not afford to lose.he plays his butt off.

great to see. great qb. remember him slinging it for the usfl houston gamblers and then the bills.
i have never in my life wished for a former saints player to join the falcons as i do corey white.
good reading jeff. you spot on.
hope you did not tell those young kids you got to go because your agent called lol
"scott, you never had a desire to get into coaching?"
they not rebuilding anything. they just realized after last season they needed to retool.
plus you just do not trade away a player who has played lights out last season.
rap sheet says they redoing kennan's contract. great to see this fire put out.
"probably in kennan;s world, but on airline drive a severe storm is brewing."
well least she knew it was a color of some kind lol
does not appear this is going to end well at all. hoping cooler heads think before they they overreact.
lot of emotion going on. cooler heads need to prevail when it comes to kennan.
"totally agree. with moves left and right going on, they should of all been hiding and shutting up."
"damn, that is more than mark ingram got."
i would not be suprised. take a look at his game stats. pretty pathetic.for a de paid as much as him.
"after last year, yes we are satisfied to what loomis and sean doing."
corey white's release has every saints fan planning a super bowl style parade.
great trade. anyone in right mind would of gladly took a 3rd rounder. extra player even sweeter.
break out the champagne.this is best news all off season so far.
chris landry saying his deal was lowered before trade. guess we will find out soon.
chris landry saying saints got his contract reduced before trade went through.
very well said. i agree. i said a 3rd i would take. adding ellerbe made this a great trade.
you can bet brees is in the loop since season ended. he knows every move.
3rd rounder what counts the most. ellerbe was extra lagniappe to deal.
i was saying anything less than a 3rd would be robbery. 3rd and player. good trade.
lock your doors and disconnect the phone bro. damn what a way to give fans a heart attack lol.
"damn, not you to my man. tell me you joking lol."
kenny stills is worth at least a 3rd rounder. anything less and we get robbed imho.
they sure as hell be getting a damn good value for him or fans going to be pissed.
"kenny was on twitter yesterday joshing about miami, so he knew this was going down."
"if they trade kenny stills, they sure as hell be get a damn good value for him."
corey white led saints in performance pay? that is ridiculous. smh.
"as a saints fan, i have to agree 100 percent. if he was to fall in saints lap you grab him."
"this guy is a young upcoming player. he was probably 2nd best dl saints had last year, tough loss."
tough loss. the guy was always making plays when he was on the field.
that damn saints hat looks great on your head. welcome to da #whodat
at this very moment jerry jones is having his glasses and the tears wiped out his eyes by his son-in-law.
"as long as we have someone who can lay the wood on someone, i will take him."
"i can clearly understand all these moves. play like crap the money we paying,get moved."
unless it means they got their eyes on amari cooper lol. they were at bama's pro day
think a bunch of players wondering if they going to be the next victim lol.
grubbs play at lg has really not been up to par considering money they were paying out.good move.
desperately begging and pleading for saints and pelican fan support lol
also center matt armstrong who was in camp with saints this training camp.
i am hearing they trying to land both browner and tramon williams as a pair.
hearing rumors they trying to sign both browner and tramon williams as a pair.
"mike check those tweets, fake account my man lol"
couple prior cut by saints. johnny patrick and just this past training camp was matt armstrong
"jsut looking at that. mickel leshoure, michael bush, johnny patrick. wilson and few more i recognize."
and just think. ryan pace is credited for being in charge of saints draft last year.
it is not like he has much choice lol
only ones that have high trade value would be b. cooks &amp; k. stills.
they not going to fix anything on defense if they keep drafting guys like they did last draft.
rt i love how drew brees plays dumb when #saints let a player of #jimmygraham's caliber go in heknowsmorethanyouthi…
better be safe john. we might find out you been traded.
wait a minute. you have patrick robinson on a top cb list? that is hilarious.
"they not to serious, last i saw, they still have corey white listed on roster as a cb. :)"
graham was only high draft value for saints to land a center they needed badly.
good move. i would not have tendered him either.guy is not that good.
they making room those superstars davidhawthorne and corey white jerseys lol.
let's hope they do not end up blowing the draft.surprised scouts were not fired after last years draft
"looking at center position, graham was only high trade value to land a good one."
"we sure as hell can not afford another disaster of a draft like last year,"
think fans are forgetting that te josh hill is no slouch playing the position.
they will calm down once they get word hawthorne and corey white going take up the slack lol
does not instill much confidence when they end up not drafting worth a damn.
well looks like they fill josh hill has flashed enough to make this trade happen.
probably only team willing to pay for a below-average lb. smh.
can not believe hawthorne and corey white have not been cut yet. these two should of been first to go.
would be willing to bet dak prescott was not being a choir boy and was innocently jumped on.
"rt the auction for the kraken kayak is now live, please read about it and share with all your friends on fb or other... ht…"
rt fully loaded kraken kayak up for auction for a great cause.
making lot of tackles and being any good is two different animals. all lb's on this team need upgrading
long overdue for a complete overhaul at lb. lofton could tackle but none of them can cover anyone.

rt source confirms #saints have agreed to terms 4 year deal mark ingram going back to #saints
when is last time they had a qb good enough to get a wr 1000 yards?
the dev's need to make the zombies more spread out though. them all lined up looks strange.
enjoyed the video lol. love these type of games.
"you notice, it is never the damn red cross doing any of this stuff. i would never give red cross a dime."
better they stay home. every day they at work they destroy america even more.
"a guy who would be pretty good to replace pt, would be terrance mcgee from lsu. similar play style."
agree. conrad dobler and many more would of not passed the temp. test back in the day.
loomis bad over priced contracts has got this team in a mess.
"don't have to thank us, we thank you for being a great player for the saints. good luck my man."
hate to see a player like this go. was such a classy and hard nose player.

springtime. finally. #peach #beer #backdeck #perfectday #clt
*schwoo* what a week. soooo ready for the weekend!
rt have i mentioned lately that i'm #hiring? join marketing technology team:
trying to beat the rain &amp; indulge in a long overdue latte #clt
i think you lucked out with tonight's 10pm fire alarm beeping. the last 2 at my house have started closer to 3am! ugh. g'night!
quick! brush your teeth &amp; save the other cookie half for tomorrow. :)
true. i'd think anyone involved in that would have lots of emotional &amp; mental reactions for a while. so sorry!
what a horrible chain of events this morning. glad for your dad. how terrible for that girl &amp; her family.
i love reading all the inspirational stories from your members - what awesome riders &amp; pulsers! #nevercoast
we had a civic for years also. you really can't go wrong with any honda imo. :)
i miss my old honda crv &amp; pilot. newer pilots are gigantic so wouldn't rebuy that but crv drove like car with lots of space.
rt another reason not to ride aero in a spinning class...
me!! i was fine yesterday. but today hit me like a ton of bricks. #needcaffeine
"i just got new, mobile-resp, modular email template. it's awesome &amp; so pretty! it does not support the watch."
rt ugly email templates are long gone - you need something responsive! #emaillove
my waist line is in big trouble when you open your s clt location! ;)
ooohhhh! they're all new &amp; shiny! i need to come check them out soon. :)
rt daylight saving time is like jet lag without the travel. (thanks for the image
"my first #postop workout was a mini session with yesterday. after 3 months of no exercise, i'm sore today. love that feeling!"
rt rt well this is just absolutely insane.
my pup &amp; i are enjoying this amazing day in our backyard. #spring #cltwx
wahoo! did you get the new keiser bikes?
great read. rt ‘calvin and hobbes’: america’s most profound comic strip
that's great news!! thanks for sharing the update. :)
i had girls' outing this evening that started at 5pm. home by 8. in pjs &amp; on the couch by 8:30. that's my kind of friday night! #wildncrazy
got letter from my doc saying they've gotten no response from you on claim from 12/2/14. who can i talk to about this?
that is helpful. thanks! i was checking out some of your options the other day &amp; wondered about the two types &amp; storing them.
graduated to balance exercises at physical therapy today. i have to push myself in march so i can return to activities in april! #postop
wondering - do most people have 2 storage options for white &amp; red? or can they all go in same one?
it's crazy out there! was so nice yesterday &amp; still warm this morning. i'm soooo ready for spring.
"ugh. stop that, mother nature! rt 68° down to 46° in one hour in charlotte! #cktwx"
uh oh! #emailmarketing rt first casl fine. compu-finder fined $1.1mm for spamming canadians:
good news! rt ap: ringling brothers ending elephant act after public concerns.
dang girl! you guys got some serious snow?!
it will be months to get back to where i was for strength &amp; flexibility. nerve damage could take a year to heal.
oh no!! i'm so sorry to see that update.
"it's going ok. too slow for my taste, of course. but making progress. a while to go to rebuild strength &amp; balance in that ankle."
glad to hear it's going well for you!
"besides getting your days mixed up, how you doing? how's the new gig working out?"
awww... love the cat-human reunion story.
"oh my - humidity is a factor too? geesh. clearly, i still have a lot to learn about wine. we did talk about needing a cooler."
"rt yes, that would have been bad. cheers to learning! here's a great infographic about wine storage. cheers!"
... but we were glad we discovered the problem when it was just us. i would have been so embarrassed had we been entertaining.
"we've been saving some of our special wines in the top of that rack, so i'm pretty sure we've ruined them all..."
we don't have a wine cooler. *gasp* our bottles are kept in built-in rack above our frig... where all the heat rises to!
this is awesome! --&gt; curt schilling tracked twitter trolls &amp; put social media ugliness on notice via
hey there - hope things are ok with your fil. sending you positive thoughts.
"i know, right? we were glad we weren't serving to guests. guess we'll have to restart our tiny collection &amp; get wine frig! :)"
correct. but our built-in wine rack is above our frig &amp; now we're wondering if it gets too warm up there for proper storage.
thank you! we gave up on the wine but our pasta dinner was delicious. :)
could be. we tried different glasses even. we'd only started with anti-pasta appetizers when we tried 1st bottle. so strange!
"disappointed we opened 5 bottles of wine for our anniversary dinner &amp; they were all bad. storage/temp issues, maybe?"
i kid. i kid. :) i've seen hardly anything worthwhile there. not sure how others support themselves on those sites
"wait, i thought they paid, like, $10 flat. well well well, i may have to reconsider my ethical email boundaries!"
"we need some seriously nice weekend weather this month for a date on their patio, right? :("
nearly all my docs are so now i'm keeping my fingers crossed i stay healthy while i still hope they fix this
hanging in there. what's new with you?
my thoughts too. rt i’m convinced 'almost' every email marketing job on freelance sites like elance and odesk are illegal.
"rt police say thief unlocks vehicle using electronic device to steal bike valued at $15,000."
"you &amp; me both. i missed out on #llamadrama and #thedress. and probably much much more, as usual."
i can't believe work got in the way of me knowing about &amp; watching #llamadrama. i miss all the fun!
seriously depressing rain! i want snow! my dog definitely wants snow.
we have a new situation developing at my house: snow &amp; rain appear to be having a negative impact on my #cltwx #snomg
"we are supposed to have 7-10"" of snow by morning. that's an insane amount of snow yet to come. #clt #cltwx #snomg"
wahoo! congrats. and what about the cookie benefits - a freezer stocked full of free cookies year-round?
"if she's going to announce it eventually, then why wait? gives yo..her a month to brag about the new gig &amp; make us jealous!"
are there concerns something might happen to *ahem* your friend's job deal over the next month?
"it's going to be money losing for both sides if they don't work out something, right? patients pay price, as always"
"despite getting a full 8-hours sleep last night (amazingly!), i've hit a brick wall today. just feel beyond exhausted lately."
i'm probably not much help since i'm with mmg. think my hubs is going to switch to novant male doc in cotswold. search fb tarts?
nothing like going down to the wire on that. my husband feels confident they'll work something out. but geesh.
"hitting the ""launch"" button on an email campaign always makes me nervous - 1k recipients or 1mm, i worry everything is 100% right every time"
any progress on contract negotiations with charlotte's mecklenburg medical group doctors? most my providers are with that group.
i usually capitalize bulleted lists. i think it's easier to read them with sentence case.
argh. are you with uhc &amp; mmg? i haven't heard any new updates on their contract negotiations. all my docs are there.
today is definitely powered by
"yep! mt employees who work remotely, more than 3/4 report greater productivity while working off site:"
"uh oh... hang in there, girlie! no week is a good week for that, i do believe. #sugaraddict #gimmeallthesugar #mosuga4me"
that earlier song performance was just confusing to me. (sorry!)
there you have it - the best moment of the #oscars - the glory song performance. wow. so great.
lol meryl and jlo's reaction!
the clothes. the acceptance speeches. the musical performances. even *gasp* nph. everything is boring.
right?? i just said the exact same thing to my husband!! #snoozefest
#yawn thinking about switching over to downton abbey.
snoooooozefest
these #oscars are rather disappointing. was also hoping for a little more entertaining snark in my twitter feed.
"wait, i thought dr skoda won... which is puzzling since l&amp;o was a tv show. #oscars"
are you at southpark? i get so turned around in that place.
i have chapstick with me 24/7. stupid winter &amp; no humidity.
hahaha!! that last basket picture was hilarious!
i'm beyond excited for the confirmation you're coming to south clt!!!
i'm sure i'd be up for an outing there. i've never been.
rt our is about to welcome baby duf #2 &amp; her send-off ride is this sun. 7:30am: just 5 bikes left!
my cat gives me the paw block too.
still thinking about last night's impressive show the music was great. but i had no idea he was so funny!
yes!! that set was awesome! loved loved loved the show!! :)
that masquerade scene was one of my faves! loved everything about the show. #clt #phantomontour
ice is melting! we'll be there! #clt rt see you tonight at #belktheater!! rt happy mardi gras!!!
our cats want nothing to do with us both at home today. they stayed in bed. #keepingwarm
rt want more sleep (and better productivity)? work from home
preparing for tonight's concert by jamming to station. #clt
"rt how do you stop your teen from texting while driving? teach by example, experts say."
"oh, good point. i think my oversized mug puts me at 4 too. but brian has been making us half-caff so that messes things all up."
rt icymi: i wrote a piece about the imperfectly perfect snl40 show yesterday.
. this is why you guys rock - your team is awesome &amp; pulls together to make up for cancelled classes.
i'm on my 2nd cup. #coffee #caffeine #needmore
here's hoping the roads are ok tonight! rt the concert is on! #happymardigras
"rt found a frozen fountain in dilworth. these icicles are so ""cool""! ;) #cltwx #ncice"
rt oh no! wiener trouble: oscar mayer wienermobile crashes in pennsylvania
"ahhh... that's very nice of you to let her hang out in warm, dry place tonight."
rt all ymca of greater charlotte branches will open on a delayed schedule tomorrow (2/17).
"""do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance"" that white stuff covering the street is not snow. #cltwx #ncice"
no wine?! i think the no sugar will kill me. i tried something similar &amp; gave up in week 2 - headaches &amp; mood swings were rough.
stay safe &amp; warm out there!
"gotta charge my phone. if we lose power, how else will i provide play-by-play updates on weather at my place tonight? #cltwx #snomg #ncice"
i'm still waiting on brian to arrive safely. he went to for one final workout before #snomg #ncice really hits!
ha! nancy looks excited to still be there. i gotta ask--did they turn off the heat when everyone else left? you're so bundled up!
it seems we have a lull in the precipitation so hope you arrived home safely. :)
rt all of our office closings and updated info can be found here:
we fully expect a video of you experiencing #thunderice &amp; cheering &amp; yelling in an over-the-top sort of way. #cltwx
good thing the banks are closed. should make rush hour at any time today a bit easier. #snomg #ncice #cltwx
figures. classes usually get canceled first. they'll try to keep branches open but since the snow/ice/sleet has started...?
i know canceled some evening classes already. i wouldn't be surprised if branches close early.
something closer to ice or sleet is definitely coming down. just picked up a few minutes ago in south clt.
something white is falling out of the sky. it's hitting the windows &amp; bouncing off sidewalk so i'm pretty sure it's not snow. #boo #cltwx
ok cool - thanks for super speedy reply! :)
you've never seen the breakfast club? you're in luck - they're re-releasing the movie next month. :)
"if i buy fitness level package for gift, can my husband upgrade to performance if he wants &amp; we pay the difference?"
ha! that's funny. and so true.
rt whose side are you on? #priorities #snomg #iceomg
rt all of our classes are still on schedule. we will let you all know as the weather develops if anything changes. ❄️
"good luck! i may try #whole30 later this year. i got their book--it starts with food--for xmas, but haven't read it yet."
"#snl40 is turning 40. breakfast club is turning 30. and yet, somehow i've managed to remain 25. #imnotold #imnotold #imnotold #denial"
rt why would they ruin #snl40 with this no talent hack kanye?
they included #landshark during weekend update. do you think we'll see another #candygram?
thank you for featuring brian &amp; me as part of your valentine's day blog post! #nevercoast #alwayslove
rt don't forget about your pets during this extreme cold. bring them indoors or provide them with a heated shelter if they mus…
"it's ok to never stop missing them. with time, it just won't hurt as much. *hugs*"
btw - we are keeping our fingers crossed for no weather impact to tuesday night harry connick jr show! #slightlyworried
long live the scrunchie! i fully support this fashion trend &amp; stand by my refusal to throw away my old ones. #worethemathome
thank you!!
oh! you're right. their website still shows 2014 dates. i totally missed that important detail! thanks 4 reply.
"do you know when tickets for nutcracker will go on sale, please? listings on carolinatix are confusing &amp; showing blank pages"
happy saturday &amp; valentine's day to you!
rt how sweet! check out brian &amp; on the blog: 💕💕💕

"thank you thank you thank you! 2013 was ah-may-zing. and please tell andy, i still think he is a ninja."
it's my friday + long weekend all at once. taking tomorrow off &amp; holiday on monday = 4 day weekend!! #ftw
thanks &amp; #sexualchocolate
on our way! can't wait!! #sexualchocolate
glad to hear things went well!! i can relate to getting your energy back. my recovery is slow going but i'm close to walking. :)
i've been told several times in the past few weeks that i look tired. wonder why... i'm seeing 2:30am again. not sleeping well these days.
hey girl - how you feeling these days? did surgery go ok for you? been thinking about you.
i often watch tv with captions on. no obvious reason why. i think i'm odd. or losing my hearing. or both.
figures. today's office visit was an exception. i won't be back up here for another 2 weeks maybe. will you stay uptown?
sorry! i'm still on crutches. my coworkers were delivering treats to me at my desk. :)
i made it into the office today &amp; someone made red velvet oreo truffles - they are awesome!
you sound like me &amp; girl scout cookies - i like to keep a few boxes in the freezer for later in the year.
sweet of you to offer but i'm good. :) i just saw you posting you were on the hunt for some. sooo... how are they?
you found the elusive oreos? the rest of the day sounds good too.
i don't know. maybe? couldn't see anything. noticed other roads possibly shut down off providence when i detoured around.
wendover (wb?) is shut down by police barricades at randolph. #clttraffic
"today's physical therapy appt: after upright bike warmup, i was promoted to walking backwards on the treadmill!! #progress #postop #ankle"
can't wait for thursday at vintner!
"rt health experts recommend standing up at desk, leaving office, never coming back"
that beer is soooo good. one of my new favorites.
rt the sunset tonight was at 6:00pm the 1st 6pm or later sunset since the time change last november. #cltwx
poor poor baby. i would love another dog buddy for my aussie but my husband &amp; cats would kill me.
lol the jury is still out if that looks so good or so wrong.
"oh, that adorable doggy face. people are horrible to have left her tied up like that. so great of you to foster her."
lol fair enough. :)
rt i’m an email developer and i have openings in my schedule. feel free to contact me. clinton skoobly .com
were you looking for the chance to shine there?
ooohhh... i'm sorry you're sick. bugs are definitely going around this time of year. hope it doesn't last long for you. :(
"the show was soooo good! if it comes to your area, you should totally check it out. :)"
oh my goodness! i'm so sorry about your aunt's passing. what a senseless tragedy for your family.
just hanging out with on stage after last night's awesome #phantomontour show
rt subtitle of my memoir:
oh no! hope you feel better soon.
yes! a friend shared a bottle with us. i joked that it smells even better than it tastes &amp; it tastes really good!
sweet baby jesus wins out over nugget nectar. we often confirm our porter/stout preference at my house. #craftbeer

"i can't get pedi's until march, maybe. :( not until recovery is complete. but i could mani while you pedi. :)"
"oh, i'm totally not a morning person. but i love you guys. and donuts. but mostly you. well, and the donuts."
"they sell out before 11am most days, but i'd get up at the crack-o-dawn for you gals!"
"if we plan ahead, i'll pick us up some for our next outing!"
as if we needed more proof! ;)
did we just both tweet about donuts at the same time?? spooky.
everyday lately! ;) rt type of day where i already want donuts and a shot of vodka. anyone with me?
i hate when driving interferes with all my other more important tasks.^
i think that's becoming more common. else you're giving away all your brain power for nada.
oh ok. i don't know how crowded it will be; i was just joking around. bummer we won't get to hang out then.
"wait, what? are you guys out for next thursday now? :("
ha! love that idea. i have feeling we may need to bring own chairs to get seats there.
you were correct on tapping time next thrs! #sexualchocolate rt 6pm officially
"whole foods had a case under lock &amp; key. at least it seemed that way. ;) super lucky - right place, right time."
"we've never been to but for 10 of your beers on tap, we may have to make the trek up there. cool!"
oh! your tapping is on the calendar. do you have a time set yet? i think we're taking friday off work too. ;)
lol you're now on the short vip list. we are going to hit up a few places next week when the kegs get tapped around town. :)
"still not sure how he managed it, but i feel like we found the holy grail! debating about who we r going to sample these with"

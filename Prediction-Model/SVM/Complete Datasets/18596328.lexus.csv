rt will definitely pray!
rt i'm technically hypo what i have is called hashimotos. yes huge pain. now i have cysts on my thyroid. scary.
"geez, okay. thank you! i will definitely bring up the autoimmune b/c this is all new to me. things were fine the last 13 yrs"
rt i fluctuate between hypo and hyper.
thank you! i will ask the doc to check for autoimmune. what a pain huh? are you hypo then?
rt that's why i'm asking if it autoimmune. it took them a year. and they still adjust constantly.
i was diagnosed at 32 with hypo. this is all i know.
rt i developed an irregular rythem. my heart was stopping and then like kick starting. it was scary
rt do you have autoimmune thuytoid? have you been tested for that? that's what i have
"how long did it take your docs to regulate you? b/c now, i've been dealing with this for 3 months. too long if you ask me."
rt trust me it happened to me. my meds were too high i lost tons of hair.
"rt that means your meds are too high, and that's extremely dangerous. plus u could lose ur hair. careful!"
now its the lowest number it can be. &amp; i am in need of my meds. just need to get regulated. i pray they figure it out soon.
&amp; thank you for reaching out to me. not many know what i'm going thru nor do they understand. so thank you! my tsh is 0.001
would u mind praying for me? my kids are worried &amp; i hate that they even know. i need healing b/c daily my &lt;3 just pounds.
it's been really hard b/c i don't want to go into a non-sustained rhythm. docs put me on &lt;3 meds but the root is my thyroid.
"again he's taking me off the med for 2 weeks to do labs. my head pounds, my &lt;3 races. i'm tired but always in high gear."
last week i ended up in the hospital but was kept longer b/c my &lt;3 was again in sinus tach rhythm. i went back to my doc &amp;
my &lt;3 was in sinus tach rhythm. docs took me off the med for 2 weeks. &amp; have slowly increased back up to 100..
this is when i learned that thyroid had crashed. my medication was too much &amp; for 2 weeks my &lt;3 was in pounding &amp; learned...
"charity, i'm having a really hard time right now. in jan my thyroid crashed. i went to the hospital b/c my &lt;3 wouldn't stop."
"the minute i drop off, he cries. aww love him!"
i miss my other daughter!

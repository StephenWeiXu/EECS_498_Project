you know something's wrong when i can't even work up the energy to plan my summer vacation. that's usually done by january.

"anytime i hear about a new movie that sounds interesting, first thing i do is check to see if there's a book on which it is based."
just saw ad for age of adaline. looks either really cool or very stupid. interesting idea though.
still catching up on reign. enjoyed seeing marie de guise tell off lola. is so great in that role.
that's awesome! very exciting.
and just now watched episode of reign in which catherine went after diana. wow. that was intense.
"after avoiding reign for weeks, i've started watching episodes saved on dvr. mary setting her rapist on fire kind of won me back."
the day sure does go by quickly when you don't get up until 5 p.m.
exactly. and i felt the attempt at something new - the twin storyline - wasn't that interesting either.
what kind of cars are you looking at? i'm thinking i want to get rid of my jeep and maybe get an xterra. maybe.
that's right. forgot about that. don't like the direction of the storyline at all.

rt opening night video! the majestic helen mirren returns to broadway in
"this weekend, i kept thermostat in my hotel room at 76 &amp; it was wonderful. i love hotel rooms. my house which i keep at 68 feels so cold."
"past weekend, my world was broadway shows, art museums, central park, cheesecake and romantic suspense novels. didn't even watch tv."
"when i know what's going on, then i'm just angry and disappointed all the time. and knowing doesn't seem to change or improve anything."
"for past two days, i've had no idea as to what was going on in the world. thinking maybe i should live like that more often."
rt it's opening nite at the audience &amp; the stars are out. &amp; among them!
it was opening night. huge crowd out front &amp; people set up with cameras. am guessing there were lots of important people there.
wow! that's so cool. wish i'd seen him. but wonder if i'd even realize it was him.
tonight i saw helen mirren in the audience on broadway. it was so great. so cool to see one of my favorite actresses on stage.
"rt on #internationalwomensday, nancy drew finally fixes daylight savings time, while the hardy boys look on helplessly."

"if not for the loud snoring, i'd be perfectly content reading my book while i wait."
oh fun. have been sitting on plane for almost hour. maintenance issues. short handed on mechanics. dude near me snoring loudly. so annoying.
i was glad someone at least noticed. no one ever notices my christmas socks when i travel around the holidays.
wore my spider-man socks knowing i'd have to take shoes off at security. it's only time anyone sees my socks. tsa guy called me spider-woman

"why do i always feel ill on fridays? this is happening way too often. by end of work day, i feel so bad. doesn't make sense."
"i have an early flight to newark, nj tomorrow. i should probably start packing. i love to go places, but i hate to pack."
"it doesn't feel like spring break. i'm at home wrapped up in a blanket, sitting next to a space heater."
"i'm never going to be able to do the whole ""healthy eating"" thing. all i want is bread &amp; potatoes &amp; cheese."
stopped at whole foods on way home &amp; bought lots of salad &amp; grilled veggies - wishing i'd filled my entire plate with mashed potatoes.

"nice. next week is our spring break as well. friday we should be fine, but it's snowing now, supposed to be icy in the morning."
i just read dan stevens aka matthew crawley has been cast as beast in the beauty &amp; the beast movie. i screamed when i read that. so perfect.
"and weather got so bad, so fast, they sent everyone home after a half day, had so many people on the road, hours to get home."

same boys who recently said they thought learning history was stupid and a waste of time because what happened in the past didn't matter.
i am so angry today. everything is pissing me off.
"i didn't say that. i said, ""well, i need to go grade"" &amp; walked out of the room. having to bite my tongue a lot today."
because of course it isn't possible for someone girly to be a feminist! we're all a bunch of wanna-be dudes. grrrr! stupid people!
"people are so annoying. i mention students wanting to start feminist club. other teacher says, ""that's surprising, she seems so girly."" omg!"
like do any national feminist organizations have high school groups?
some students asked if i'd sponsor their feminist club. i said yes. but am in search of info about other high school feminist clubs. ideas?
when you visit an organization's website in search of information &amp; all you can find is a page asking for money - kind of annoying :/

i didn't realize it was this upcoming weekend - we all should have make plans to go.
"and ian does do comic cons, not just vampire diaries conventions."
i think the vampire diaries convention in atlanta is going to include a tour of the set where they film.
i love it. i like it more than vampire diaries now. klaus is so sexy and such a badass.
"""i will never again receive an immoral proposition from a man,"" - the dowager countess - this kind of broke my heart. #downtonpbs"
do you watch the originals also? i finally caught up on vampire diaries during my ice days. tired of the twins storyline.
"yep, that was exactly what happened to me. they could send a guy that next week &amp; i said, no, verizon can be here in two days"
"but by then, i'd already made an appointment for the fios installation. no regrets."
i was so sick of directtv. they were going to charge for a repair guy to visit until i said i was cancelling.
that's the problem with it - not available everywhere. it was a very big deal when it became available in my neighborhood.
"yes, they've had some beautiful ones in the past. but the whole ditching the wedding for some adventure is perfect."
i kept something from them about twice a week. i'm not switching back. wasting their time. i love my verizon fios.
"they've started sending what appear to be cards with my address handwritten, w/ a person's name on return label. so annoying"
i loved it. it's like finally some advertisers are realizing we're here.
"oh wow, didn't even realize that was natalie portman in the miss dior commercial."
that miss dior ad set to janis joplin may be the greatest thing ever. i seriously want to go buy a bottle of that perfume right now.
"because we left school early friday, i brought home lots of work to grade. guess how much grading i've done? you probably guessed correctly."
"be prepared for the nonstop ""we want you back"" letters. like a creepy ex who can't take a hint five years later."
i'll have to think about that. casablanca is first though. and his girl friday would also make the list.
"of course, now it is considered ""classic"" 15 or so years later, but even when i first saw it, it felt like that. timeless, not trendy"
"i feel like it has an old movie, classic feel to it. almost like casablanca with the forbidden love &amp; internal conflict."
having seen the movie made the book easier for me to understand.
"first time i saw it was in college, we had free passes &amp; no one had ever heard of it, had no idea what to expect. was amazing."
"it's such a beautiful movie, so well made and a wonderful love story. let me know what you think of it."
english patient is such a great movie. easily one of my top five favorite movies.
do i keep watching kobe documentary or change channel to english patient? such difficult decisions. really not liking documentary that much.
at least we're in good company :) i think i've finally reached a point in my life in which i'm okay with being boring.
this is one of those moments in which i realize i'm not all that cool. i'm a little bit boring. oh well.
"a little odd to try and figure out the highlights of the past twenty years of my life, and still try to make myself sound cool :/"
writing a message to a college friend i recently found on facebook who i've not heard from in about twenty years.

"when i said i already had ticket to broadway show i really wanted to see, she offered to let me stay at her apartment while she's gone."
"when my friend in nyc found out i wanted to go there for spring break, but she'd be gone, she invited me on her birthday trip."
i am really lucky to have such awesome friends. i just wish they didn't all live so far away.
"i'd considered the audio books. but last year, spent all school year going through outlander series in audio books."
"when it first started, i put off watching it because i wanted to read book first, but then never got around to it."
"i've never watched the show, but i remember twitter going crazy the night that happened."
"rt new fairy tales have been discovered, and they're darker, dirtier &amp; more gender bending than the ol' brothers grimm"
i'm so tired of cold weather. i hate winter.

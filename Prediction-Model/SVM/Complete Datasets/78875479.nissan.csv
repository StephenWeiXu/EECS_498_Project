"lots of running today good luck everyone, go rip it up. i'm still trying not to cough up a lung or 2 so i'll give it a miss again today."
get well soon. you made the right decision.

there's a certain amount of self navigation but i enjoyed running thro forests and snape area.
it's in ipswich isn't it? norwich is 2 loops as well. it's never fitted my plans but might do it this year
have you ever done ipswich half as ive never done it and i'm thinking about dropping back to halfs for autumn?
i did the intro ultra last year (came 4th and 1st in v40 male) lovely route only downside no medal
do think who ever checks notifications is beginning to realise what bunch of lunatics runners are?

he's always bike beside me on long runs if he's not playing footie. great to get kids active.
that's the word!
i hope so he's now at the grand age of 13 thinking about doing a 5k colour run with me this summer
it was when he was 3 left him with chest prob and asthmatic and why i ran first marathons for
i reckon i'll be alright by monday or tuesday. just keep bloody coughing it's started to hurt chest a tad annoying
it's unavoidable sometimes unfortunately. my son's been very poorly with pneumonia b4 so a cough for me is nothing.
i've gone and got myself a proper good cough. coughed so hard i appear to have hurt my neck 😧 you've gotta laugh😂
hope you back on form soon
"my wife normally says to me after every marathon ""you look awful, are you alright?"" way to boost my confidence"
why do you reach (is that the right word) when you cough? or is that just me?
snotty mess with hurt legs describes me on my long runs 😂😤
it plans on your mind but you really do need to forget it and remember to look around and enjoy it. it's a remarkable race.
i didn't help myself my challenge was 2 marathons in 2 weeks and i'd done my first ever marathon the week b4 london
"i'm fine. just for once i'm being sensible, it won't last. 😧"
hell! i've just picked up horrible cough. hope your feeling better and out running soon. it's quite frustrating isn't it?
i'm alright just i'm coughing so much it hurts and to be honest it's getting bloody annoying.
i enjoyed last year's marathons as none were for charity all were for fun.
i have and the pressure to finish because of charity etc was a bit much so didn't enjoy it they way i should have.
i'm doing my best to spread it by coughing over the family.😧
good luck at london. it's a wonderful race don't pressure yourself as it a race to savour and enjoy.
young man! 😂
no running as i've a stinking cold i'm coughing so much i've got a pain in my neck. so i'm going to be really grumpy now!
it was but it meant i didn't expect much from race so no pressure on myself and got a new pb!
i may take dog in a while but it's raining quite hard here so may send wife out instead.
last year i managed to pick up stomach bug week b4 lost1/2 st which wasn't best prep
next race in 2 weeks.
i'm going to work and hide up somewhere. tho if you follow the coughing sound you'll find me. 😧
i'm not normally sensible but decided that running wouldn't be a good idea today.
i'm only kidding about back but can't control my coughing at all. more pissed off that i can't go running.
i'm not normally sensible but i want to do some long runs over easter and this week's an easy week anyway.
don't tell me that!
i'm alright. it's the uncontrollable coughing that's rather annoying.
better now than in 2 weeks. i could run but it wouldn't be a good idea to be honest.
run plans abandoned due to feeling like crap 😢 i may have dislocated my spine through coughing 😱
i'm going to cough a lung up in a minute. 😷😱

rt 24 days till the big day of 183.4miles via
i use belt as if it's cups ofvwater i tend to tip drink up my nose. it's what i'm comfortable with really.
i use salamon hydration belt or ultimate direction hydration vest for long runs otherwise rely on pockets in shorts
i keep sticking to the floor in the student i'm working in
me to. i'm doing a tour of our favourite shops like dave's comics and the lego shop. making a short break of it.
"sounds fine to me, it's to easy to panic and over do it . good luck."
i'm not perfect quick stuff like 10k races are where it i piçk up injuries. like slower running like ultras.
"brighton, bungay, suffolk heritage coast then running from london to brighton"
like it! good on her.
thanks. i'm genuinely excited by the challenge and can't wait to get to the start line.
i sell these things in my little shop so try everything
what does physio say?
my wife enters me into races she wants to do so i pace her and carry her drinks.
"i've done a few, brighton is after easter. i do 2 long runs at weekend to get ready for running london 2 brighton"
i see what you did there. 😂
ouch (even though i don't know what that is) will you be ok to run?
i wired a tea blending plant several years ago #uselessfact

you see i'm doing it wrong i'm doing 2*50k over easter then on 12th #100ktraining
i'm down friday and hoping to have tea and cake people on the saturday afternoon. like to meet you if you've time
my ultimate is kyoto then tokyo the following week.
not so keen on fennel tho.
steady even pace and fuel are key all as you've done in training and its a doddle. honest!
"rt thank you! yes ive been told about that, it'll be the runner screaming inside of me…"
i only ever wanted to run a 10k 😳 now i'm an addict
i love hot cross buns toasted with butter this time of year as well.
"run tourism is what i enjoy about this sport. seeing things and places, meeting people it's all part of the experience #ukrunchat"

rt we do simon. we are currently in 80 stores nationwide and growing week on we…
rt yes for a list of stores please visit
the world can only cope with one martin powell. what day are you going to brighton?
thank you for joining us.
thanks.
wow! i'm struggling to get my 5 mile runs down to that time at the minute.
nice. ginger and lemon is my favourite fruit tea.
"good will that be you last ""long run""?"
"sponsorship etc added pressure i'd not thought of is the greatest so relax, go steady, enjoy"
where you running in june? #addictedlketherestofus
as you can see i'm still nearly quarter of an hour behind much like my 10k races!
good luck! i'll follow with interest. you know you'll finish say never again then sign up for more!
i think i'm going to have to do manchester as it supposed to be fast and flat and coming from norfolk i like flat.
do you sell in shops as well as online?
that sound like a nice race is that off-road! #ukrunchat
i agree there's an abundance of good running shops now so try before you buy.
👍 thank you.
rt thanks a lot guys! #fastesthouroftheweek
i use and think they've made a mistake but they sponsored lance armstrong!
"rt haha, hope you had a great one, that went fast! ill definitely be checking out your sit…"
loose leaf tea or tea bags? and what sort of tea? i'm quite partial to a nice assam.
rt same here!
hell you're quick! i dream of getting sub 42 without tearing every muscle.
8 marathons and 2 ultra marathons plus several halfs not sure how many 10k as they hurt more
"i did and was so scared of failure i didn't enjoy it, i now wish i'd relaxed and taken it in."
i haven't touched my glass of wine yet!
it is scary but i've run a few and if you fear it you won't enjoy it and you have to enjoy london.
⏰ i hadn't realised it's gone 9. that was fun. did you enjoy that thanks 👍
"you doing then there's still time, just don't rush it."
rest it. take it easy the hard works been done. fingers crossed
i think you get what you pay 4 it does pay to shop around my local shops cheaper than online
the skins are my favourite. swear by them never had cramp when wearing my skins tights.
i'm sure you'll be fine. remember to not get swept up in everyone else's race at the start
you'll beat that i saw your 20 mile time the other week.
plus a beer?
it why i made my first marathon as i knew the place so well and it does help alot
very very normal. i was petrified but as soon as you finish that feeling is indescribable
i normally wear just skins compression gear under shorts.
don't forget steady even pace and run your own race #ukrunchat
good. this your first?
i'm going steady and doing it for fun no pressure this year so going to enjoy myself.
personally i'd do 20-22 miler then slowly taper ready for the big day. but that's me
rt looks like you can stream from here and via iplayer radio app …
not ideal prep for a marathon head in a toilet for 2 days but it worked. i wouldn't recommend it tho
my best time was without a plan and getting stomach bug week b4 and losing half a stone being sick

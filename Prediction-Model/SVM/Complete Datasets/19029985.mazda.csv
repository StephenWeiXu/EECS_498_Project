"i need the cargo space, and i'm not removing my spare tire."
"well, i upgraded my car stereo to bluetooth, so now i think i'll add on either better speakers or a subwoofer that is not in the cargo area."
"the video i watched showed cars that looked high end: bmw, lexus; where's the love for ""normal cars"" like fords, mazdas or kias?"

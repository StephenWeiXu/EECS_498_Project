gotta love having a bad head ache on my night off...👊😠
it's depressing when i just filled my gas tank with $60 a day and a half ago and i'm already to half tank..i haven't went anywhere....

why are my head aches so painful?! i need to go to the doctor.
get to take my jeep to a mechanic again so they can take the dash out once again and so i can spend 400! can't wait!
yeah you probably did the right thing. you shouldn't have very many points any way tho so you're good.
i worked in place of you tonight. you called in too soon. i was nappin with addison when you texted me.
when do the problems stop with my jeep.....#moneypit

no.
i don't think heredia was with jmm for part 3. but jmm did look a lot different.curious what kind of s&amp;c he had b4.
and all is credited to ariza?
"ya. but why would floyd hire ariza w/heredia consulting, given their track record. did they really improve their guys?"
how many wins vs losses does ariza and heredia have with their fighters? pascal just lost. maidana lost and rios lost.
i remember a glove issue with maidana that wasn't in the contract.
what is the history of in regards to boxing?
it doesn't really matter which preference now. pacquiao agreed to
i remember something about gloves when it came to the maidana fight. it wasn't in the contract.
pretty motivating?
rt florida cop arrested for producing child porn with a 2-year-old girl

"have you seen/heard of this dance group from the philippines,"
have you seen this philippines dance group called
but can he be orthodox and still remain effective?
people saying rigondeaux is too small to use. didn't roach use calderon in sparring with oscar for his fight w/floyd?
"pac calls drug test for may 2. and if usada tests that day, two blood samples taken out on fight day. possibility?"
i think that would mess with floyd's mind for real.
you've to get pacquiao to call in that test on may 2 right around that time.
all it takes is a picture from to start a rumor. lol.
i'm also wondering if there's a cutoff date for this call-in surprise test.
"i think floyd really thinks pac is on something, calling for a test this far put from the fight. maybe catching him."
"is that osdt?lol.if i am pac,save it for day of fight,while undercards are going on."
rt australian boxer smith dies following fight with filipino
this guy wins.
"do a poll ""who are you rooting for? or on may 2?"""
"you said in the video that most people in the boxing world, trainers and fighters, going with floyd.why don't u do a poll?"
he used to chop wood back in grand rapids?
nice to see comment about boxing. it doesn't hurt or boxing when you do.
i wish the pacquiao camp would be just as quiet.
"since is the underdog, are you rooting for him?"
hopefully this whole group of people get arrested.
when was this?
i'm part of that club too.
maybe was practicing his mma for a future fight against

"rt finally got to see vs josesito lopez. a very exciting and well fought fight, tarnished by poor..."

hook a brother up. #teampacquiao
at event!! turn it to can feel sweat that isn't my own.
congrats on the victory.
gotta agree with you.
holy cow. what a first round. this isn't an fight for sure.
watching boxing on is actually showing it.
"don't understand why businesses are hesitant to show boxing, especially when it's on free tv."
no fear trunks also.
do you have ?
i'm going with rooting and thinking he will win.
march 11 was the day of pac/may press conference. it's pretty much what a lot of press cares about in boxing.
and it will be his second fight in 2015 and it will be in may. plenty of time to fight others.
maybe this is a better question. who are you rooting for on may 2?
march 11 has come and gone.
47 have tried? isn't it 45?
one question. #tmt or #teampacquiao?
i guess that is his response to what people saw about him during press conference.
it's even more clear? everyone else saw how clear it was 5 years ago.
i saw it. different than first day. i don't think he'll overtrain. it has never been an issue in the past.
i just sprayed a million perfumes on me and can't remember the one i wanted üò©üò∑‚Äù can you help jessica out? thnx.
i think the best part was seeing how smooth was with
have an idea what they will be around on the monday of fight week?
i think needs to cut down in the interviews and such. we need him to train.
"save it for another night. as much as fans would want a bang for their buck, why do it(if i were haymon)."
i don't.
he's got a guy with a right like floyd. another that's quick. he needs a bigger guy now. bring in luis arias.
guillermo doing a good job at the press conference.

how can you lose something you never had?
what is #pfw?
"damn. have to say, that the girl held her own and then some. shame nobody stopped it."
hey i will never forget this.
true. all he had to do is say yes.
you going to vegas for he fight?
thought it was some bad cyst that needed to get operated on. i was getting ready to cry.
you sure?
not me.
not worth busting a blood vessel. lol
calm down man. lol.
rt yo can u investigate this lump on pac's right wrist. i cant be the 1 only to see this.
not watching press conference. people behaving at pacquiao/mayweather. kovalev and pascal get into it. am i hearing this right?
how much were tickets to this?
floyd...cause you know...he's letting his hands go. lol
rt sergey kovalev &amp; jean pascal scuffle during their face-off today
"well, he did pretty much say he's going for mayweather."
look out! he koed a guy in sparring!
that's the first time i've heard talk trash. love it. lol.
we will never forget about this one though.
"bars/nightclubs have been doing it for years. why should they get away with it, but not restaurants?"
what do you think of the possibility being with the i'm from houston and i would like to see it happen.
do you know what a decade is? just curious.
lol. you do know the difference between light welterweight and lightweight right?
so you really can't admit you're wrong about your facts?
still can't answer can you? alvarado is too unstable. wasn't a sure thing for macao.
hard for you to answer the question or admitting you don't know your facts.
why did manny fight rios coming off a loss at lightweight? üòÇ i'll wait‚Äù rios vs alvarado at lightweight.
"lol. according to you, rios was coming off a loss at lightweight before fighting pacquiao."
so was rios coming from lightweight?
and you are discrediting pacquiao.
yes. but so was pacquiao. what's hard to understand about that?
he never fought at welter before. but get your facts straight first. you said rios was coming off a loss at lightweight.yes or no?
but it's boxing. so it's okay.
rios is more of a welter than light welter or lightweight.
and rios wasn't coming off a loss at lightweight. but it's rios. so it's okay.
so you think pacquiao should have gotten a shot at a title right after a loss?
you mean pacquiao could have fought mayweather after being koed by marquez?
"people saying floyd will school pac or this is too easy for floyd. if it is, go ahead and bet $100k on floyd."
rt pacman2 at wild card gym today! #maypac
"and floyd throws it first, but he isn't aggressive.i would think judges see it very favorably for floyd."
"agree with you. people mentioning the straight/lead right, but that jab is so quick, hard to counter when already moving."
wishful thinking. i know.
"in the end, did paulie ask what happens when you put pac in with any of the top welterweights?"
that morning group run looks like it's getting bigger. get more people to run with make it look like rocky.
is that ray beltran doing ab work also?
"so all of a sudden, floyd is going to fight aggressively against a guy like pacquiao? he's giving roach what he wants? right."
why?
"how do you think would feel, if pacquiao has more fans than he has, living in the united states?"
"i know it's a bit early, but do you think a matchup between and joseph diaz jr. is possible?"
"lol. at first, i was like ""oscar's fighting the olympian? top rank already matching them up?"""
the one that fought lomachenko and mares?
it's what roach wants. for floyd to come fight pacquiao toe to toe. so don't think it happens fight night.
"as much as i like to get updates, maybe it's time to shutdown all social media when it comes to pac's training."
is that really all i see is some dude all dressed fancy.
good thing is here in the u.s. training instead of playing basketball.
does al haymon have any women fighters signed?
according to and will be shooting a commercial on 3/11.
"so the commercial we saw on about the fight(just floyd, no pacquiao) is not the final commercial?"
i can't hear it. i'm working.
good stuff. just wished it wasn't haymon. lol
""
you think that was the only commercial? no pacquiao.
was that the official ppv pacquiao vs maywesther commercial?
about to watch lose on watching it at
"i think broner, but if broner was trying to make weight several days before weigh-in, how does it affect him tonight?"
"thanks. after many years of no boxing on regular tv, it's back tonight on"
hey are you going to have some tvs on big night of boxing and on regular tv.
he should.
"ya, but if you don't like lampley or malignaggi, you're screwed."
"i can see retailers doing a ""festivus sale."""
more people should be thanking god for atheists if it is.
how about a holiday for atheists?
"do a poll ""who are you rooting for may 2? rt for floyd. favorite for pacquiao."""
holy cow. she's 50 years old?
lol. boxing peeps are such pessimists.
wise words.
he needs to run with pac.
what worries me is floyd doesn't throw volume like &amp; roach needs to find a real defensive guy.
exactly. pac will get a first time look at &amp; just like when he steps in against floyd.
have and go up against judah and chop chop and my money is on the two younger guys.
dang it. didn't wake up early enough to watch undercards of shiming fight.
congratulations!
i'm sure executives at cartoon network don't want him.
"""knowledge of the enemy's dispositions can only be obtained from other men."" -sun tzu. alex ariza was hired why?"
#teampacquiao should read the art of war.
"""appear strong when you are weak.appear weak when you are strong."" #artofwar"
+ &gt; + #teampacquiao
how about pacquiao's sparring partners in sims and ellis? ellis looks like he has that straight right like floyd.
you ever watch oscar valdez fight? those two may be on a collision course some day.
i missed some boxing tonight. got to see at instead.
what weight did he fight? featherweight?
i missed it. going to have to find video of it.
"besides pacquiao vs mayweather, what other fights would you like to see made? #asksugarray"
you need to get people to run behind in the streets like rocky.
wearing my team munoz t-shirt today.
"hey have you heard of story? if you haven't, read this."
i think people are envious of what is doing. it's totally awesome.
"rt ""i'm not going to change who i am just because people think it's weird."""
"yes. in last 5 years, i've gone back and forth. even on paper, i see floyd having most advantages."

maths jokes make me happi.
"no majority decision on abacuses, abacus or abaci. anyway, most of the football journalists i know will be counting on their fingers."
abacuses? abaci?
it's #nufc accounts day. expect a lot of football journalists have their abucuses out.

"i know, that's why i did it. still feels incredibly wrong though."
"it was also anti-tory. *digs, digs, digs*"
"sorry, sorry, sorry."
"full of curry, shortbread, mucus and self-loathing. that peter hitchens retweet... that will keep me awake at night."
"i know, i'm appalled by me."
"and, technically, it wasn't peter hitchens, just his column. tell you what, i'll shush now. sorry for everything."
"but i did spell his name wrong, so that helps."
i just retweeted peter hitchins. away for a lie down...
rt peter hitchens is considering voting labour in protest at the hounding of ed miliband:
looking forward to visiting there.

at the 5-a-side for fantastic event. trying to find lad who had his stag do last night.
stupid husband's given me his stupid cold. woke up sneezing and clutching night nurse. not happy.
"on my way alex. full of cold, and feeling a bit grim, so won't stay long or breathe near anyone though! hope it's going well?"
i just know we had a date and they didn't show. *sees off full glass of the juniper stuff*
"*hears nothing back from dr hook, drinks more gin, listens to julie covington, rings friends and rants*"
too late. she was not happy.
they're ace. you're not.
*texts dr hook faux breezy message and sobs*
'caught' but had it overturned. represented himself and was very atticus finch.
"supposed to be at dr hook tonight but they've postponed. stood up by dr hook, feeling worthless, sitting on the stairs, drinking gin."
"awful, i know. i'm punishing myself by reading and eating fudge."
true. hope you get sorted too.
bah. i blame my new banjo car! x
hope so. what a kack start to the weekend :(

glad you found a positive way to address those issues. not easy to do.
keep meaning to investigate netball every autumn and always forget. i miss team sports.
how so?
exactly!
"yup, if my knees agree. my head says, 'that was ace!' but my knees are quite annoyed."
i like a swim. but you can have good and bad swims depending on how busy the pool is!
"feel like i proved something to myself today. running can be as important for your head, as your body."
"for various reasons, today was my first proper run for months. tough, and i was slow as treacle, but much better mileage than i hoped for."
here you go:
cash and directions to would be an acceptable gift for anyone.
but jazz hands are so versatile!
thanks for this great to hear #itfc fans are involved in north east events too:
"your friend who wasn't a tit, yes?"
"a useful reminder! although, and i hate to point this out, you're looking at your phone now. ;)"
"'from the moment i stepped into the venue, i knew i was going to hate *mumbles* call me a tit... *chunters*"
"you failed quite spectacularly there, didnâ€™t you."
sounds great. will be doing that.
i already know that. and so does he.
they estimated your worth pretty accurately at the door then? ;)
"weird, wasn't it. utterly irrelevant."
rt if any of you were on the fence about voting labour:
i'm scared.
you don't want to meet my parents...
"rt would just like to clarify, i'm no relation to kay burley. thanks."
"dear my timeline, you're lovely and left. thank you. lots of love and snogs, me. xxx"

fascinating stuff today!
rt here's that extraordinary charles walker speech
"lowest form of scum, that."
"ha ha ha! well, we must do this again sometime. taxi!"
leave it davey! he's not worth it!
"hang on, we've agreed to disagree? i say no it doesn't! *fingers in ears* lalalalalalalala! lalalalalala!"
"me. always, me."
i blame simon for all this. he started it so it's his fault ;) nice to have reasoned discussion - and on twitter?!
"this isn't about football clubs and how they should/shouldn't be, it's about educating very young people."
"for me, that's a different discussion. i don't believe this was appropriate in a classroom for reasons i've given."
"teaching entitlement, deceit and then public shaming when you don't like what you hear. not a fan!"
helpful with no comms team get things right 100% of the time. this excercise seems to me to be...
ha ha! no! i concede it's hard for me to be objective because i work with fc press teams who are hugely...
i know what you mean but not all pupils interested in football/the letters were a lie. could be much improved.
lush people. and what a great pic!
y'day: mt huge congrats to as they celebrate their 7th anniversary!
"rt brilliant concept from west brom, hope it's a huge success you won't want to miss this... #astleday hâ€¦"
love this. are really good. very supportive of too. great club.
more appropriate (and engaging) surely? and publicising results afterwards? not for me.
"writing personal letters with queries that matter to the individual pupil, to whichever organisation they pick..."
this has been interesting. thank you! twitter did good.
it's both of those things. and a way to engage pupils in writing. seems to teach sense of entitlement too though.
"i'm not keen. what does this teach? they're just football clubs. should be hope, not expectation, they'll reply?"
i've just puked up my alpen. i hope you're happy.
nice. thanks for that mental picture glenn. :(

"andy, have we discussed the difference between twitter, porn and reality?"

this goes against almost everything i believe but... i agree with luke.
stop being helpful. you sicken me.
don't look directly at her.

i used to hate my full name. quite like it now. age!
great name. great.

"you mean, clogging up timeline? yes, yes it is."
sounds like a grim day pet. x
that's wonderful! thank you. :)
it's what i deserve.
i was hoping you'd do a snazzy tweet for me with tigger in the middle. my hopes were dashed. naught but confusion.
"i like my cat, tigger."
you are my hero.
she seemed quite freaked out by this pie attack:
thank you. big team effort!
stop showing off.
come back then! bring the monkey too! all welcome :)

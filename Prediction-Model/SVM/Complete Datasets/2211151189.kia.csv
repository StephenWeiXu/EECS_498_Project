i don't know why the #leafs don't rest their veterans and bring up every prospect they have for the rest of the season.

anyone know what kind of vehicle bud polhill drove last year? #ldnont
the vehicle allowance would likely cost us more than expenses.
maybe someone will go back and do a rough calculation of how much extra a per/km formula would have costed taxpayers.
a monthly allowance for vehicle costs ensures we pay for something we may not. i prefer a milage allowance on official business. #ldnont

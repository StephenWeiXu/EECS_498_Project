the c7.r trans am car looks awesome
is it possible for falken to catch the ferrari?
if in doubt poultry out
i'm sorry to say but they look like a team destined for a 1st round exit
time for to jump the 62 ferrari.
and things go from bad to worse
3 shots...3...against arazona...who traded everyone worth trading...3 shots?
"how about giving up a short handed goal in less then 2 minutes? chances of an 1st round flame out, 100%"
and i've just lost interest in the pens game
i think i read 7:48pm est
"let's see a google search for not much there. a google search for ayerton senna? well, i think i've said enough"

"no, the other teams should show up ready to go, not wait till the season and start testing"

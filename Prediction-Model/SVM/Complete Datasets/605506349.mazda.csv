"another thing, my battery lasts over 24 hours on the lumia 830 vs 12 or less on the lumia 928...odd. maybe its just the age though."
haha. me too! much better image sensor i think.
i was pleasantly surprised. :3
okay. lumia 928 (left) vs lumia 830 (right) #camera #lumia
true! that's a nice feature. only my sister and brother in law have them...so no need for me. haha
yea let me take one with both. stay tuned. haha
"i'm not missing iphone at all. but that's me. :) i have all the apps i use as well, except for snapchat but eh."

verizon. by switching we can save money and have phones we actually want. :p
i haven't really played with it but it takes awesome outdoor shots. we need to switch to t-mobile before he can really use it.
i meant to get up 3 hours ago. instead i got like 12 hours of sleep. :p

japan import. special edition.
right. that's the only reason to keep it and buy a ps4. not a good reason.
"so, i think i'm going to sell that white/pink vita. i have no reason to keep it. only game i would play is destiny...do i really need that?"
i still got it. ricochet in halo is da best. scored 3/4 shots.
i just wanna xbox. is that too much to ask?
house planning takes so much freaking time. jeez. xd
oh noooo.
that's...interesting.
"so, i know it's been forever since i played xbox with you guys, but tonight is the night! what are you all playing?"
had a good 30 min snooze while my son apparently played halo on my phone. like mother like son. üòÉ
i'm so sleepy. lots of fresh air today. zzzzz

we can save $50 a month if we switch. it's really quite expensive. :(
oh. the 1020. it's old. i want newer tech. ;)
which is that?
never heard of either of them. older?
looks like i could possibly afford the blu win hd if my 928 sells. not bad.
any suggestions on tmobile windows phones? would love a decent camera...but its not a deal breaker. not much of a budget either.
guess i never did renew the tabs. that's what happens when you park a car for a while! oops. no driving until they come in. :p
...that moment when you can't find the license plate tabs you know you paid for...
oh. and its a manual. best kind of car. i'm even part of a local mazda group. had big plans for my car. #carnerd
she's got 216k miles. engine runs like a dream. i love that car. too bad the rust has taken its toll. it's a 2001 mazda protege es. :3

mood: drake attitude: kanye
"you're a bad idea, but i like bad ideas"
sometimes you just gotta realize people don't give a fuck about you

i want to be your 3 am thoughts
"i gave you my heart, don't break it"
rt this is the best thing i've seen all day..
attracted to you in ways i can't explain
deep conversation with the best people
"rt ""what's up?"" me: my anxiety..."
"things happen, people change"

lack of communication leaves too much room for imagination
sleepless nights
what even are feelings?
"rt i dont fuck with alot of people, simple as that"

rt fifty shades of don't send me mixed signals
i think i wanted it too much and you didn't want it enough
"it's about who you miss at 2 in the afternoon when you're busy, not 2 in the morning when you are lonely"
rt i usually ignore everyone so if i talk to you it's something real
rt believe. rt seriously lady gaga on american horror story #gagaahshotel i just can't believe
i wish you would text back...
i could look in your eyes until the sun comes up
"my voice is silent, but my heart is screaming"

he climbed into the bed and folded himself around her

rt 2015 resolution: don't fuck it up
"i can't just forget and move on, it's not that simple."
"and if someone asks about me one day, what will you leave out – what will you say?"
someone once told me to be careful when trying to fix a broken person for you might cut yourself on their shattered pieces

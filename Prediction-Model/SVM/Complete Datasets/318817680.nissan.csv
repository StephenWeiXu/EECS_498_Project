rt sub in lang. best friday every
"""let's invite people over to watch lyndsay cry tonight while watching glee"" 😕"
unsettling energy on the home front is not yet about to disapp... more for sagittarius
rt this is so important
tomorrow is the glee finale and just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach. #sosad
the people that made my life hell at the beginning of this school year still want to try to bug me?¿ #nobueno
it's funny how some people can be your best friend outside of school until they are around people who they'd rather be around than you.
i need to come home and catch up on glee because i won't stop putting off watching it so it lasts longer
should be practicing my solo for musical theatre tomorrow but
every time i get my nails done (after they cut me with that drill thing) i almost fall asleep
so tired i can't even park
"i can't start the quiz because i know if i do, she will show up and i'll have to stop"
i would have liked to be in bed by now
because i am still not home
when does the apush quiz have to be done by
babysitting aka doing no homework
my new car has an ac problem so i need it to get a little less hot outside so i can live
cant find a song to sing for musical theatre i hate this era
i'm so amazed i can't even make a sentence
some giant truck just almost hit my car and my car is in the my driveway
#mirrorselfie featuring the beautiful flowers i got from my family for lucky stiff last week! 💗💐
lauryn just spent 5 minutes ranting to boger about her problems i love it
i'm wearing a dress with sailboats on it so automatically it's a good day
spent 20 minutes of my morning to read a majority of tweets and i am so not ashamed.
rt saying that video games cause violence is like saying watching tmz will make you sniff markers and sometimes glue but mostl…
just cut my hand on a water bottle i'm going to sue
i have one percent plagiarism i am so happy
i am so bad at conclusions
"this paper says the word ""film"" at least 30 times"
jk i put together two things and now i'm laying in the floor
spending my sunday afternoon building ikea furniture.
rt really need to write my rough draft but i don't want to
kill me i hate car washes
probably going to end up spending my day helping lauryn clean her car
no more loser cruisers!
rt i can't wait to be done with my research paper
first real drive in my car and i'm going to lowes.
rt
i literally just want to sleep in but now that i woke up i will never go back to sleep
i'm so ready to go take my car places tomorrow
meet my new car! 2003 nissan murano! 😃😃😃😃 pearl the pt cruiser finally met her doom.
i have been at honda since 2:00. perks of buying a car.
duhhhh
come back to nc and ride with me in my new car
about to get rid of my pt loser
"""we are professional people-watchers"""
i thought the act was draining until i took the sat. i need a nap.
where is the warmth i want to wear norts
it's saturday and i'm awake already. no bueno.
so you're sure i can't skip the sat and stay home to watch movies? damn.
rt if i didn't have to take the sat tomorrow i would be much happier right now
you know you're tired when you totally forget that your favorite tv show is on
rt ☀️🌟☀️ tbh ilyyy and you were my director almost a year ago [wow] and you're such a good singer/actress and you're so pretty
stop lyin
how good
but it's good right
i'm gonna need these film schools to stop sending me mail and depressing me with the thought of not being able to go there
not going to school stresses me out so bad
i really need to do homework but i reeeaaaallly want to sit here and eat cough drops so i will stop coughing
🙋
watching ellen and realizing that lea michele is literally the same person as me
so truth be told none of us really got the entire plot of lucky stiff until today
i got an interview for my precal paper i am successful
i'm ready for prom
do i feel bad for missing beta club so i could go to mcdonalds with lauryn? not in the slightest.
josh groban album comes out on april 28th sisnfkaoxhakendoan 😭😃😭😃😭
"rt april 28th will change your ears and hearts forever, because slays da showtunes: #theg…"
lauryn and i walked in the garage and the lights flickered really slowly it was so crazy
there is a ghost in our garage
thank you!!
i feel so free! so many of us have basically lived in the theatre since october.
rt when tech week rolls around and you're just like
i haven't had dinner in the past two nights in so excited for tonight
if you wait 20 minutes we will come get you
lauryn is mad at me for playing phantom of the opera too loud and i think she's a hater
i've had theatre fourth period 3 semesters in a row 😳
striking set in fourth period calls for bum clothes allllllll day
can i go back to being sick now
now i can finally stop taking all that stupid medicine
this is the first time i haven't finished my precal homework and i'm not even worried because i'm just so tired
dressing room panorama in case you wanted it 👍
it's over.
when people bring things up that they know make me uncomfortable it really hurts my feelings not gonna lie
it's your last chance! we will be saying au revoir to monte carlo tonight and you don't want to miss…
today is not good
i don't remember lol sorry
if there's any day i would like to just drink tea and stay home today would be it.
if cornett can come see our show so can you
i just made a phantom of the opera joke to my family and i got no response. uncultured.
i know everything happens for a reason but getting a cold the day before opening night had no good reason
what is sleep
"one more chance to see our flawless show, lucky stiff! ✌️💰🐶🎶🔫🎲"
"rt you have one more night to see what i have put blood, sweat, and (mostly) tears into. tomorrow at 7 pm. lucky stiff. be …"
there's a water bottle exhibit backstage
yayyy
come see lucky stiff tonight!
i don't like singing on the announcements it makes me nervous
new goal for the rest of the day is to be positive because so far everything to come out of my mouth has been negative
no plans and nothing to do tonight? lucky stiff is at 7pm for $7! 🔫🎲🎶💰🐶
happy birthday to my favorite fashion model! #dad 💗
i'm so ready for senior year
we cute
so much adrenaline i am never going to sleep
come see the old ladies in lucky stiff tomorrow and tuesday night at 7pm!!!
"rt hey guys, if you're free tonight (or if you aren't, cancel your plans) you should come to jmrhs 7 to see lucky stiff! it…"
"seriously. if you want to be in a good mood tonight, come see lucky stiff! $7 at 7pm!"
i can't contain my excitement for tonight
something funny's going on...tonight at 7pm! lucky stiff. be there. 🎶🎲🐶🔫💰
rt are you bored and have nothing to do??? come see lucky stiff! $7 at 7pm!
how many times have i watched phantom of the opera on netflix? far too many times. #favoritemusical #canibechristine
"rt everyone come out and see lucky stiff!!! tonight, tomorrow, and tuesday at 7pm at jay m robinson high school!"
""
if you think i'm not going to drink 20 bottles of water before call time you're wrong
let me see
tbh sleeping with a humidifier tonight would be a+
tbh i am really bummed that my voice won't sound as good as it would if i didn't have a cold.
trying to decide if i should do homework or if i should attempt to sleep off this nasty sickness for opening night
some guy at the car lot was trying to flirt with me until he found out i was in high school 😂😂😂
"opening night is tomorrow night 🐶🔫🎲🎶💰 come see lucky stiff tomorrow night at 7pm! trust me,…"
lucky stiff. tomorrow. 7pm. be there. 🎲🐶💰🔫🎶
final dress rehearsal!
"diet coke, it is."
my dad made me try his tea that he drinks every morning and i'm gagging
rehearsal in 3 hours and i am really not sure how i'm going to sing
how much airborne can you take
""
rt i was waiting on you at the door *tilts head* *throws hammer*
rt 😂😂😂😂
""
yes i am i am all that and a bag of chips
""
tomorrow is our final dress rehearsal and i am sick.
now is a horrible time to get sick
my dad is making me stay out tonight so he can watch his tv show 👎
going to bed aka going to go listen to phantom of the opera
only one 7pm rehearsal this week? i'll take it.
this is 40 is my family's favorite movie
i have so much homework and my computer isn't working 👌
"rt feeling like a soccer mom right now picking up lyndsay, isabel and alaina up from rehearsal"
eating mac and cheese in the dressing room during a run is honestly the only way to live your life.
i lost my favorite watch and i'm devastated
also a year ago today i was planning the best promposal in the entire world (no they didn't end up going to prom but it was still amazing)
a year ago today i got my car and in a few weeks i won't have it anymore 😳
pearl (my car) let me down today.
"rt judge your worth and value by what god says about you in his word, not by how somebody else treats you. (ephesians 2:4-10)"
my dad met vanna white today ?¿
the smell of smoke outside is because of me sorry friends
my car is smoking in the school parking lot what a great day
i love being secretary for tri-m but i don't love all the work that comes with it. it's like an extra class.
when lauryn is sick and doesn't go to school it feels very weird
i just looked it up to see if it was a real thing. it's not.
"things just got really weird between me and pinterest when i misread ""how to shave your legs"" as ""how to shave your hips"" #whatamimissing"
so much homework to do while i just sit here eating an apple pie from mcdonalds ✌️👌
relationship goals af 😂 this is everything 😍😍😍😍
my nonfiction book for ap lang is rob lowe's autobiography and i'm not ashamed at all
also did no pre-cal homework last night so now i'm going to drown in it tonight
usually i would not wear pink sneakers with a maroon shirt but today i really dont care
taking the act calls for yoga pants and only halfway doing your hair...right?
i am so hurt right now
since when do colleges randomly call?¿
doing homework no can do
i was friends with until he hit me on the shoulder with a hammer
after-rehearsal hair and no makeup while out to eat. so scandalous.
my car is empty water bottles and special k bar wrappers
"""i forgot how to school"""
"i wonder how many times i'm going to hear people say ""i forgot everything!"" today"
we open in 7 days i repeat lucky stiff opens in seven days
the amount of airborne i took today is questionable
don't stress! life happens!! 👍 stay positive!
""
rt tech week begins tomorrow....
"""what's a fun fact about you lyndsay?"" ""well i have three coupon apps on my phone"""
"i'm about to have the great ""find lyndsay's red pants"" adventure."
help my outline is still only two pages
"my dad said that if i said ""snow"" one more time i'd be grounded 😂😂😂"
rt we having ever type of weather possible in one week....
still confused as to why they did the joseph movie like they did with the school setting it isnt right and it confuses me
we've got a long tech week ahead of us and a show in one week and my entire family is sick with some flu thing.
the only thing i'm allowing myself to do today is my outline
"fun fact so today i put on makeup (not everyday makeup, like glam makeup) and straightened my hair and got dressed in like 10 minutes"
hung out with these cool cats tonight. #loveyall belk theater at blumenthal performing arts center
success
best. night. ever. #josephustour
loved meeting and tonight 🎉🎉
rt had so much fun seeing #josephustour and ace and diana! thank you for being great as always.
#josephustour 😍😍😍
i have to get semi-glammed up in less than an hour's time. 😭😭😭
seeing a show gets me just as pumped as performing in a show
rt today should be great😄💁✌️
going to the bank and to get my nails done with no makeup and i'm not sorry
friday night at 10:30 and my eyes are getting heavier and heavier. this is not what being 17 should feel like.
rt *checks bank account*
like i would refuse to come in the classroom upset
very very very upset
if we don't do duets in musical theatre this semester i am going to be very upset
knowing what you want to do and where you want to go to college really sucks when you're a junior and very impatient.
where is my family why isn't anybody here
slowly learning to live my life with some spontaneity.
rt #neverforget

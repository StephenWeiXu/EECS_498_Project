excellent! this makes me happy :-)
turns out my sources were wrong. donuts from the monash market ... huzzah!
upon reflection i have decided that i don't care if it's donut or doughnut ... i'll eat either!
i've been told there is no jam donut van at monash market -&gt; sad
belated birthday drinks and dinner with at trumpy and northern git ... happy :-)
do you think i could count my compiled to-do lists as an academic output?
oh yes! rt i love to-do lists. i rewrite them every morning.
i'll keep my eyes open for a stockist ... meanwhile i've found a salted caramel muffin with icing and gooey caramel centre!
"i'm now working just across the road (almost) at monash, you should pop round for a madagascan vanilla tea!"
"... also, we're yet to find places for everything we already own!"
we did a reconnaissance mission for next time. need to ease into it - overwhelming ...
i'm introducing to costco ... this could be dangerous!
#circleofniceness rocks!
does this mean we get to swap roles and i get to play editor for version 2? ;-)
i've been given a work ipad ... those who know me know what this means ... but i finally have the head space to learn how to use this beast!
day 2 of a new job in a new uni but being back in the doctoral education space feels a bit like coming home
made me wonder what the comments to the editor looked like
"ah, the memories of our foray into being scottish academic warriors!"
little wander around the neighbourhood accomplished. and i did some good exploring - showing him the hood now he's moved in :-)
what is one to do on a deliciously dreary cold melbourne day? lie around knitting &amp; watching dvds. but now i need a little wander!

#anu3mt2014 we still have so much to understand about the brain. good to see work on improving vision testing after stroke.
#anu3mt2014 really enjoying hearing about the research being conducted by anu's phd students. so engaging!
#anu3mt2014 the importance of context and how difficult it isto challenge something if you've been taught not to see it.

i can't make it either :-( i'm really sorry guys. you'll have to #suaw without me tomorrow
"i'm happy if the others are? details: gypsy hideout, westgarth, around 8 am, this friday"
sounds good to me
"let's do northside, proper #suaw. fri 16 aug from 8am. westgarth cafe suggestions?"
we're on for #suaw next fri! what about westgarth somewhere at 8.00? or at la trobe?
northside rocks :-)
i think i'm still free for next fri if you're keen and if it's just us i could meet you earlier near home
woohoo!!!!
twas nothing. i will thank #nontweetingnigel (as he got us onto circles in the first place) &amp; hot chips!
i don't like days where i don't get to stop for lunch until 4pm. but i don't mind then having rice pudding for lunch as compensation.

makes you think rt what is really examined? maybe not just the thesis #phdchat
i've thought a lot about what i'd do diff if i had my time over - it's fun feeding those through the results
the work &amp; i are doing is providing a new lens for reflecting on the 'what i'd do differently' thoughts
rt loved this by on how phds aren't just about the thesis: &gt;&gt; 1000x yes to frustration …
i was very happy to be able to add to the pile of things on the table to prove it was being used well!
hooray for chicken burrito #circleofniceness with
"thanks, survived first day back in reality. chicken burrito very soon! what are your lunch plans this week?"
thanks! saw it pop up with the new title :-)
yup. today may be a struggle.
the #writingmadness retreat in canberra with last week was awesome. now back to reality ... after more coffee.
"that sucks, but welcome home!!!!"
i had that happen last year (diff airline). only redeeming feature was that it was the flight home rather than the way over :-(
thanks for a fab &amp; productive time mt just dropped at the airport #writingmadness is over. back to reality.
word dat! (did i say that right? i really am not down with these hip sayings ...)
i'm using this tonight when all the ice-cream disappears ... not that it would disappear
is making me watch the filmclip to 'what does the fox say' #writingmadness has turned into dance party
we've worked hard so time to play! #worklifebalance is needed even in #writingmadness
"it was indeed a thing ... a feather-coated, sleeveless, vest thing. you would have liked this shop!"

"for those following the #writingmadness that &amp; i are enjoying, today's playlist is jangly guitar music. noice!"
"busy busy! mt just worked out we have enough data for 2 papers, not 1. oh my #writingmadness #daytwo"
credibility is so easily lost when ice cream is at stake
the caramel sundaes that we didn't buy and scoff are causing slight sugar overload...
it wasn't and i at the maccas drive through and there is no way you can prove otherwise!
"and it made it back on rotation this evening. tomorrow, no daft punk!"
"good lord, xanadu has just come on, how did i not see that on the list?!"
"wait, i had credibility?!? will i further damage it if i admit i also used to watch it's a knockout during the same era?"
i'm sure i can blame young talent time for doing a cover at some point - i had all their casettes!
i'm a bit concerned by how many words i know to 'total eclipse of the heart' ...

"right, now and i are getting no work done as we dance in our seats to 'dancing in the dark' ..."
bring it on! rt yes you shall now be subjected to “dodgy but awesome”...
i should warn you that when we get to #28 we must sing into our hairbrushes very loudly and badly!

"other than sitting in a plastic box that sounds good. my weeks are admin, strategy, teaching"

bunya mountains holiday.
agreed. thankfully it's not long till our canberra research-nerd-out!
it's slowly dawning that i'm now on holidays. i'd be more excited if i wasn't still sick (with all the incomplete work tasks that entails).

hooray! me too :-) i can't commit to proper #suaw's at the mo but mini ones (ie 2 pomodoros) i could sneak away regularly for!
"wish i could be there, but i have germs. have fun!"
"maybe we can break it down together and get each other moving with regular, mini #suaw sessions over the moat with coffee?"
i'm on day 4 and exhausted. glad you're feeling better!
i calculate that the evil lurgy has now afflicted 1/3 of our office (me included). we are obviously good at sharing.
we have at least 1 ad in our little sample that made us think it was for someone already in the job
that would be how i'd do it too. my knowledge is minimal but at least i'm aware of that fact :-)
the thing is that i'm not tech savvy enough to even create a blog to put the lesson online :-)
"(sorry, hadn't meant you were a retiree, brain now misfiring from having to make my implicit knowledge explicit)"
"forget noble, i think there could be a market in this!"
perhaps i could make my fortune giving facebook lessons to confused retirees?
have just done a facebook lesson. need cake!

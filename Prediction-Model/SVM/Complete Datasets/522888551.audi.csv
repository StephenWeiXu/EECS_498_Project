when i clean up i ain't gonna lie i don't look half bad
what they gotta say now
family over everything
blessed with the life i live even if it ain't perfect that's why i love it

i have always ben attracted to light skin hispanics females
in need of planning a vacation
young generation being misguided
i'm hungry as fuck
if it's meant to be then it's meant to be
feeling like a slave
born a king

literally the most annoying person i've ever dealt with.
this thing was pretty awesome.
i'm fucking over today now
i have the worse fucking headache
closest i've ever came to blacking out lol
on my way home i seen a man pulled over being given the field sobriety test while he was in a kilt... you sir done fucked up.
"finally home for dinner once, and its not gonna be a home cooked meal..."
happy st. patrick day everyone!!!
i just wanna live and experience the most outta this life. fuck sleep.

"""i prefer disabled american""""why don't you stand up for yourself""""stand up and face me like a man"" heard these joke being made to a crippled"
200 miles in 3 days kills me
so hungry
i'm either gonna get my jeep stuck or arrested but fuck it
well today's been the biggest waste ever.
my jeep has this awesome ability to always make my day better. something almost nothing else can do.
in less then a mile i've seen 6 people pulled over on the highway. livinoia pd are ruthless today.
pretty much over today and it just started.
if i could sleep instead of laying here thinking that would be awesome.
if my life is half as great as this i'll be one happy guy.
i just want my jeep in my driveway and for me to be in my bed. tired of worrying and overstocking. and trying to make everyone else happy
2 hours and 5 miles later i arrived!!!
or doing something fun at least..
wish i was napping right now..
not even the simplest things go easy
with the way my luck is going i can't imagine what will happen tonight or in the upcoming weeks..
bullshit
i'm tired of waking up with so much on my mind. but last day of work this week then a four day weekend!!!
another great day and great night with friends. that no sleep life

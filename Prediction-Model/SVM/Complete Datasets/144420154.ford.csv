nooo that sucks i am sorry
oh no are you still sick? i would come to zotz but it is far alas
wait i know why it's good it's because the whole thing is like irish drinking songs
hey do you guys wanna go to fair grinds later? we can do actual work and discuss our lists!
i think maybe the first 3 are the best songs ever and then it goes a bit downhill
i would have skipped back but easy money is so good it convinced me to continue!
also is wrecking ball the best album!? it's just the thing for when you're in the mood for born in the usa but sick of it!
omg will you blurb my future book w this
oooh like when he sees the glory of the comin of the lord? that's such a good part
there is a lake in my hometown that is exactly like that and it is called darlington! all roads lead to bruce
i just looked that up and the book is a ref to the song!
omg is easy money like an anti-romantic atlantic city? i love this
listening to we take care of our own now and woah its so good! time to give wrecking ball a chance!
"we should schedule a meeting, like wouldn't it be fun if this was our job, to get at core truth of bruce's best"
also i think maybe spirit in the night is his most sexist song. i need a lyrical content disclaimer
and they are more my favs than best because otherwise born to run would replace spirit in the night. this was hard!

it was all i knew of him for so long! prob why my love was delayed
ah shit okay i have been working on it and i totally respect yours! this is a good activity the hour of 2oclock has flown by
workin on the highway is far more worth apologizing for! like the music vid i imagine for this song...
ok i am now listening to it with the ears of a person who defends it and i get that it's embarrassing but i still love it!
yeah it's all just so like.... american lol
i think i like it because it it especially good at creating that weird sense of nostalgia he does. also the word darlington
lol aram loves glory days it is the only bruce he likes
woah rly? i may just be in the mood for it but darlington county i'm on fire downbound train dancing in the dark plus yours!
also born in the usa has such a high percentage of best songs
i just realized after lucky town i've heard nothing but should probably delve
also maybe best song on every album would be a fun list
ok maybe we should give in to the impulse though
what's good about those songs is like they are quintessentially what is good!
like thunder road and atlantic city...also the river..i also love reason to believe and now i want to make a top ten list!

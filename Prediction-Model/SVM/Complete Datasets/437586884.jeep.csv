"covers everything from painting, print making, photography, film, drawing, art practicing etc."
"that's kinda how i'm feeling cause i'm so use to doing art for my own personal reasons, not for a grade. fine arts basically"

i'm tired of humans.
i have really bad insomnia and i hate every bit of it. i'm tired and need sleep.

i'm almost 19 and still have no idea what the hell i'm doing.
"i get irritated when people say they want to be 18 already. no, you actually don't want to be. it sucks and you will feel like an ass."
ok but still
i agree completely. i want to hear what tom releases in march
yes i suppose. it just really sucks knowing that i will possibly never see all three of them in blink again.
"not interested in blink-182 right at this point. without tom, it isn't blink-182."
dammit i love him so much i just don't show it
my boyfriend hates me
i am very confused with life and the bullshit that comes with it

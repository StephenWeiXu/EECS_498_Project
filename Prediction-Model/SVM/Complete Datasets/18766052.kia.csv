i'm very happy that i grew before smartphones.
seems like that'll be the way for me as well then. let me know if you hear about anything else.
looks worth the price of admission just to see all of the summons.
nice! i wish i knew. i don't frequent the forums nearly as much as i used to.
"just finished the lineart for a #masamuneshirow fanart. babes and robots, man."
i wonder if t-boz and chilli have tried any of zach braffs work or if were just too turned off initially.
i paid off my kia once.
every now and then in life i'll make a very good decision. hopefully this is the case for you as well!
where's wal-mart? #budgetbooks
sometimes i still can manage to make to about 5am or so. i always pass out sooner or later though.
what? i have to take a disc out and then insert another disc to play one game? my phone has over 30 games.
"true. i just feel they gain their ""retro"" label based solely on the mechanics of starting the game."
"if you could fist fight any animal (extinct or not) and win, what animal would it be?"
earthbound got the shaft on the soundtrack apparently? i'm pre-disappointed.
is any game with a cartridge or cd considered #retrogaming now? you damn kids and all your digitalness.
sometimes you gotta eat a trash burger.

"just read part 2 of your ""fat girl"" comics. great work! very funny and hopefully enlightening to a lot of people."
i spend more time shuffling my music than listening to it.
"if you emote ""thank you"" after someone concedes in hearthstone, you're a dickhead."
anyone else notice that mark cuban looks like an alive frankenstein?

"speaking of, #legendofzelda music is amazing. i'm not treading any new ground here, i just felt it needed to be said."
#gamingconfessions i listen to videogame music more than i listen to regular music.
"everyone that i know personally played #smashbros for #1night. haven't seen them since. it's sad, really. it, or me. one of the two."
"in case any of my 15 followerz were wondering, i'm just going to use # twitter to complain about shit now. i gotta get this evil out."
i don't know if the world is ending or if i'm just bored.
i can't be the only one annoyed that #smashbros doesn't remember my name or character. #pleasefix #please #thanks

any of them named boots? maybe bucket?
"just entered ""prophets foretelling the golden age of gaming"" as one of my reasons for purchasing #smashbros on those surveys"
i haven't used mine for its intended purpose in years. it must be confused.
"too long, haha! it's still faster than the last one i did though. once i can do that in a half hour or so, i should be good."
"you dodged a bullet, man. the graphics were nice. that's about it, haha!"

my twitter stopped twittering right and now i can't twitter anymore.
"you had me at ""but"" and then even more at ""seriously though"""
just took two #flips through your book and i'm curious why i never got invited. #illbefriends
#advertising on websites where i don't normally see advertising (i.e. mobile apps) makes me hate those companies and i never buy their stuff

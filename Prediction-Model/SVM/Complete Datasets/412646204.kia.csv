exactly
"one of the predictive text responses is ""sorry, no"" i love my phone"
is 11am too early to go get chicken b/c i'm already hungry
i mean i want to be in my bed more but i'll settle for a smoothie
dude i want a smoothie from jamba
the worst thing is waking up feeling like you got no sleep 😔😴
the weather these past few days has been nothing short of absolutely gorgeous ☺️☀️🌻
how could it be little me had the power to be the best b in the league yeah inevitably but could it be little me you was hecklin' me
rt i had fun tonight with
why do bad things happen to good people
as we're driving away they came back on i'm so angry
they turned the green lights off on my favorite building in dallas
tonight is such a good night!
i absolutely hate getting coins back when i use cash like i almost want to throw it away
every time i walk into target i want popcorn
i just discovered that since my phone is a different size all the emojis are rearranged 😑
does anybody know which phone store has the best priced tempered glass cause i just got a new phone tonight and i'm gonna crack it
i'm at my friends apartment looking for wifi so i can back my phone up and uh
"my kia soul's name is kia soul.... clever, i know"
"looks like it's another game of ""how far can kia soul go on a quarter tank"" 😅😛"
okay but yik yak is actually fun only if you're on a college campus like everything i post on there has been 🔥🔥🔥
rt today is already so good and it's gonna keep getting better 😍🙏
"rt i'm in such a good mood today, for once in forever lol"
rt friday is the happiest day of the week
from what i can see a majority of people are in a good mood today and i love it because i am too ☺️☺️
already awake for the day and i'm super tired still but i have a feeling today's going to be a good day!
thank you jake i appreciate that!!
thank you omg i love you and yes it's absolutely true 😭 i'm trying slowly but surely to phase it out but it's a process
me: *brings chick-fil-a into kwik kar while my car gets inspected and gets stared at by 3 other adults for eating*
u ever have those days when ur just like yo i'm feelin myself b/c that's today for me
why isn't there a chick-fil-a in pittsburgh
"do it or just call headquarters every day and be like ""when is one coming to pittsburgh"" .....or say ""is this the krusty krab"""
that's disrespectful
that's a really long time dude haha do they not have them in pittsburgh or what's the deal yo
like i think i'm going to chick-fil-a instead b/c it's a lot closer but still i need to know because it's very important
i forgot to update you guys as if anyone literally cares but i've only been drinking one soda every other day so i'm making progress 🙇
wait are chicken fries seriously a thing again or no because i'm about to drive 15 miles to burger king to get them
ayyyy i passed my math test 😛😛
i'm not going to get like any sleep tonight and idk why cause i put in workkkkk today hahah
i love you too 💜💜
rt i love you
count ya blessinz
apparently you have to be going at least literally 85mph or over on 121 to not get passed 😐
this sounds really bad but next semester i'm not making any new friends because i'm so tired of driving people around
the snooze button is by far one of the top 10 dumbest ideas ever
it's like i want to be in love with somebody but i don't want to love anybody.... yeah
i was really trying to avoid the math tutoring center before my test tomorrow but i'm so lost even after studying all day😭
i just wanna go to a real university already.... community college has its benefits for sure but it also definitely has major drawbacks
sometimes i just wanna like give up on college b/c it's so stressful but i never actually would
i miss you so much too guhhhh 😿😿
really wanting to start eating differently and try being healthier
ily kyle i want to go to downtown dallas with you one day
my back hurts 99% of the time so after working 9-5 today i decided to take a bath and i made it too hot and i'm currently frying
would switching from an iphone 6 to a 6 plus be stupid because part of me wants to but the other part thinks no
tonight is sufficiently awkward lmao
when you have super exciting news but you don't want to tell anybody but you tweet about it anyways
yo if i had the money i'd get a 2015 mustang
quality over quantity
liiiiiiike i luv my friendzz sososo0o0o0 much💙😽💨🎂🍻🎉🎈🎁✨
personal read:
still going to use instagram but i'm going to try and stay off twitter for a while. bye
"when people are like 😱😱😱 ""you eat so slow!!!!"" girl don't act brand new you know i'm the slowest eater alive"
there's this girl walking across the parking lot so slow as if it's not even raining and i'm dying laughing in my car
dude
i truly do think having so many cloudy/rainy days in a row has put me in a horrible mood that i can't get out of
currently school and being away from the family i do have here but other than that nothing
half of my family is here and this is where i was born so it's home to me but other than that i can't wait to get out of here
help i'm trapped in the stupid state of texas and i can't get out
i was gonna text you but i didn't want to wake you up like i always seem to do :-)))
yo i don't know how i haven't seen this but it's the funniest thing i've seen all day oh my god
"i'm writing a paper that's due online in an hour and i almost just typed ""haha"" in it omg i'm so done"
i got an 88 on my first gov. test and i took another today and got an 88 again 😐 all i need is 2 more points what did i do to deserve this

my parents just told me i need to get my eyes checked because they both think it's white and gold..... wrong
"rt if you see white &amp; gold, you're 50 shades of wrong"

i feel like trash tonight 😷
"i'm gonna cry, i love you so much 😿❤️"
dude my car smells like feet wtf
me walking out of work at 8:00 and the mall closes at 9:00 so i don't have to close the store: 😏😏😏
i love you
*drives around parking lot 7 times just to make sure i didn't miss a closer parking spot*
"if you plan on driving fast today that's on you, wreck your own car but don't ride my bumper like i'm doing something wrong"
yo tcc if my car slides into a curb and i almost bend my rims during my 20 mile commute like last time it iced you're buying me new rims👌
"all tcc campuses and facilities will be open during regular business hours, wednesday, february 25.” .....oh"
""
""
"except cheese enchiladas are the love of my life, see the problem"
i thought i misspelled enchiladas and that for me would be like stabbing the love of my life in the heart
dude i want cheese enchiladas
feelzzzz
cold and rainy weather yaaaas guhhhhhh ❄️☔️
"i can think of like 50,002 places i'd rather be than closing tonight at work💀"

the struggle is very real today
this just scared me so bad 😭
yoooo i was wondering if they did or not because i love the one my car came with too but i wouldn't wanna downgrade! thank you 😁
i want a nissan altima
i'm a walking example that getting only 4-5 hours of sleep a night doesn't work
i wanna buy another red bull but i would probably die if i drank 2 in a day
dawwwww ilysm!!!💖💖 i just miss ya and want to hang out with yewww 😿
#yolo if that's even still a thing hahah p.s. sorry i woke you up this morning :-(((
i need to stay awake to take my math test so
not gonna lie though i kind of like being out early in the morning and being productive. it just sucks getting out of bed
i can't believe i'm already out of bed and at jamba..... never make appointments at 8:30am on your off day😴
"i'll never understand how it's 31 degrees outside and people think ""today's a great day to wear shorts"""
i wonder if it's possible to get the money back on my iphone 6 because i'm very over it and would like even a partial refund
i will fly to pittsburgh and beat you with a union ring
i have to clock in at work in ten minutes and i'm at a restaurant eating cheese fries👌
"so where's the rain and ""snow"" at tho"
maybe dis 1?!??!?!:-)))
valentine's day is straight up stupid 💙😙
technology is so cool dude what magnificent time to be alive
i went to the gym tonight and did a really good workout but now it's bad cause i'm contemplating rewarding myself with pizza
i like so many people that work at this restaurant my friend works at and a lot of them want me to apply i just know i can't handle serving
on my way to the kia dealership to get my car fixed which if you're me going to a dealership sucks cause i always want a new car
just paid $4.62 for the worst pretzel and drink i think i've ever had from auntie anne's😐
so i'm almost positive i bombed my psychology test but aced my government test
made it to school already and class doesn't start til 9:05. i've been impressing myself a lot lately hahahah
"yet colleges/universities can legally charge college students ""out of state"" tuition. funny..... but i'm chillin"
"in article iv, section 2 which is the ""privileges and immunities clause"" ....prevents states from discriminating against non-residents"
so everyone knows i'm not political at all but i'm studying for government currently and i ran into something kinda funny
i did math homework for like 4 hours today and now i'm studying for my government and psychology tests tomorrow.. i'm so proud of myself
i don't think anybody understands how much i really do care about the weather🌞
today's weather is heart eyes emoji
"i don't care if you're honest with me but if you're going to be rude too then just talk behind my back, i don't want to hear that"
there's a gigantic difference between being honest and being flat out rude. some people need to learn the difference
i think it's adorable when teachers are passionate about the subject they're teaching
it's so nice outside and i'm stuck indoors in my government class 😭
forgot i had psychology homework until the moment i got in bed but it's all good cause i just crammed so hard for tomorrow haha
so glad to be off work 😙
it feels so good to be back at the gym! and it's twice as nice because it's practically empty
thank god i only have two 55 minute classes today 🙌
dude i want a 370z so bad
today was weird and i've been awake for 18 almost 19 hours now
i'm finally home and about to take a shower 😴
today's going to be an extremely long day but i'm excited and nervous at the same time!
this psychology outline i'm doing was assigned yesterday and is due tomorrow. i'm stressin 💀
getting half off new work clothes👌
never again will i take a 12:30-1:50 class 😖
i'll never understand why people have to tear others down. if you don't like what someone else is doing let that go and move on
"apparently people at my school have a problem with me trying to look nice for school.... i'm doin me and you're mad. i win, have a nice day"
when you're in the mood to spend a lot of money buying clothes online but you realize you're broke af
mom and i ordered pizza and had a movie night 🍕❤️ perfect way to spend a rainy saturday night
one of the very few things i'm looking forward to about summer is that i can lay out and tan again and not be shockingly pale anymore
"word of the day: ""stupididness"""
i know everybody's judging me because i'm wearing sweatpants in public but i couldn't care less because i'm so comfy 😙
why does the bluetooth in my car never work like i can make phone calls but it won't play my music 😐
legitimately about to fall asleep 😴
i live for 55 minute classes
yep it's been decided i'm going to school in a comfy jacket and sweatpants
today's such a good day! 😁
i'm diggin' this whole getting to school early thing i've managed to pull off so far this semester 🌞
i'm already awake 💀
today's weather makes me miss la so much 😿
today is such a great and beautiful day! ☺️☀️
i want to lay in the sun and take a nap it's that nice outside
i got to school 30 minutes early this morning.... who even am i
one of my goals for 2015 is to not get pulled over even once and i'm really hoping i don't especially for a lightbulb being out
is it even possible to get a ticket for only one of the lights above your license plate being out
some lady just got mad at me because i told her i couldn't return an item from a different store at my store....?
the car with the 'world's most uncomfortable seats' award goes to my kia soul 😐
"i just said to my mom on the phone ""do me a favor, if we're going anywhere today can you drive because i will get a ticket today"""
nobody said life would be easy but they also didn't say it would make me want to have a mental breakdown every half hour
i'm with my friend and she's applying for an apartment and i'm literally so scared to get my own place now that i think about it
the tempered glass i have on my phone is dented but not cracked.... i didn't know that was even possible

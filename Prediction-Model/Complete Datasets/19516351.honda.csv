this is why people actually debating over whether it's legit or not oh my god ""well it doesn't seem legit but there could be some chance it's real, we'd better wait and see"" ~ somebody for real people whose site looks like a really bad livejournal and who seem to be using rpgmaker to make this ""official"" remake ""i have my doubts"" says some forum user about whether or not unknown game makers have the rights to do an official ff remake except for maybe chie and yukiko but well but ultimately p4 erases every trace of queerness it adds so w;elp to be fair if i had yosuke harassing me about it all the time i'd say i wasn't either you can not escape but it still has some of the best customization i've seen in a game b/c cheating made that game unplayable i hope one day there is a private server for apb so i can play w/just my friends and not have anyone cheat me letting everyone else at the farm know who's in charge same i was afraid i ruined the whole game oh thank god i just checked an faq and you can get married later in wp815 if you dont' start the game married a) this is horrid and b) is that really the joke you're opening with in 2014 why are farming simulator 15, civilization and counterstrike in the same genre strategy might be one of the most useless game categorizations out there my laptop barely runs cities...i wonder if that's a sign that it's time to upgrade what do you mean that's not a geographical map i know how to design trains, just straight lines with other straight lines comin off of them rt i like how theres just this huge section of youtube thats just american men shooting consumer electronics w guns that shoul‚Ä¶ i got some garlic bread today and it's harder bread than i normally like but man i'ts been a while since garlic bread whew thats' good news can you rebind those keys my keyboard doesn't have page up/dn do i have to connect the touhou keyboard again,,,,,, maybe i'll make an early dinner whiel i wait for this game to download i'll look into it after i've played a bit then i'm grabbin em while the game downloads oh ya that sucks i want a huge map had to buy the game through the browser and force the country localization b/c steam is fussy about me bein in japan what were the mods you said to get again?

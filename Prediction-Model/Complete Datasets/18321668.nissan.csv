"and ben and i talked privately, as we usually do. we understand each other, and i always have his back. all it took was one word. ""transphobic men"". that's it. instead, for being male, i got lumped in with all of the assholes. the snarkiest reply earned me my golden star. i really don't understand what the issue was. seemed like pent up anger. i, too, am now blocked. i guess i won the bullshitting contest? and i didn't have to be angry! ah! i, too, dabble in bullshitting. rt booohooo i’m not an equalist. or a feminist. i’m an agent of consent. rt right rt jimbo fisher doesn't understand why there are questions about jameis winston's character hahaha i have taken my joke to googles, and it's apparently dancehall reggae. 'equality' rt nope. men are not important sorry. is there a name for the music with the air horns in it? like unz unz unz unz bluuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrr unz unz unz unz does that mean i'm important? absolutely. so are you, so is she, so is he, so is everyone. the reaction is what really did it. i can't support people that i can't trust to use words accurately. that doesn't mean i don't support the cause. i started to type out a response, but i realized we've completely gone off the rails of the discussion. :) that's the equivalent of 'i have a black friend, i'm not racist'. this is exactly what i'm saying, i completely agree. adding one word completely changes that sentence. it's unrealistic in some cases, but in this one it was one word. just one. i question whether its omission wasn't on purpose. twitter limits characters and words, but i really hate generalitiesvused to describe complex issues like race and gender. i can't lend my voice to a person that doesn't have the time to use one word for accuracy. everyone's important. i need a lot of things, and i don't get them when i don't deserve them. that's how life works. you don't have to say, ""not all men"". add a single word that says what you mean. if you can't do that, you don't deserve my voice. use your words and say that. i am not going make assumptions, because those present the same issues. here's how to get an ally: preface that statement with one word ""transphobic"". unless your subject is all men... and i think it was. oh, i'll support it, but not vocally, and not behind that person. they've pushed themselves away, they don't get my voice. right. the people that do this need the support of those that are on their side. this is distancing support. see my timeline. it should (maybe) still show there. and that interaction with avb is exactly how causes lose vocal supporters. there are good reasons that people don't voice reasonable support of unreasonable people, no matter if they agree on the topic. everyone's important. both positively, and negatively. ""men""? i don't feel entitled to fuck or murder anyone. i do feel entitled to not be included in that generalization. where's marms when you need him? rt looking at the price of the yeezy boosts &amp; tidal, i want to sit in a room with kanye &amp; jay &amp; have them guess prices of regul… has no one told him about spotify? rips through both tsm and clg to turn their split around and finish 2nd place going into the playoffs, with a first round bye. where you go? for example, a mexican coke is really almost pungent. it will take over any flavor. pig iron is a good complement to food. had a pig iron cola today it says it has a strong cola flavor, but i felt it was subtle enough to enjoy. just pull one of these, you'll be ok bb: feeling giffy today, i suppose.  izzo &gt; calamari tell me if you haven't heard this before: justin verlander is hurt! lots of rotations, though. no backup cameras in the '13/'14 model? ▇ ▅ █ ▅ ▇ ▂ ▃ ▁ ▁ ▅ ▃ ▅ ▅ ▄ ▅ ▇ and he's getting by on driving, not having the best car. haha might have a ring, doesn't make ya blind. yeah, i really like that pink headband. you have to beat kentucky, they're not going to beat themselves. yeeeeeeeeep. ""we played horrible and made many mistakes, we pulled off the win. i though nd played great."" i dunno, my salt runs high, tweets need bp medicine. that interview was straight up disrespectful trash. his worst 5 are still the best 5 in comparison to any team. he has to be a good coach. even above average. because every mcdonald's all-american would follow him. he's a great recruiter. give him west virginia's roster, and let's see how he does. after all, calipari dis say they played poorly and still beat notre dame, who played great. what a douche. here's your decoder ring for that feed: let's see how the irish celebrate. man, calipari is a twat. i can't believe that interview, such a cockmonger. right. it's not 1990, 3 steps isn't called. that was the joke. calipari just basically said his team played like shit and still won. what's that? and kentucky is your ncaa division i national champion. they asses be crowned. hey guys, football has way too many breaks in play. how was she doing that with her nose? kentucky makes their 83-foot three, notre dame makes their 85-foot three or if you didn't advertise at every sporting event in the world, including every football net in existence. you have 3:45 left, so about 30 minutes in real-time. probably happens an average of twice a game. that's ok, if they eliminate tv timeouts. commercial, score, commercial, kickoff, commercial, first play of next drive. absolutely. same with the nfl. but even those count as timeouts (if they're incorrectly challenged). the problem is the increased number of tv timeouts. football hardly has any timeouts. it's 3 per side per half. the problem is the amount of time challenges take. has anyone considered reducing the number of timeouts in a basketball game by like... 75%? there were just 4 1990 traveling fouls. that converts to 0 in 2015 terms. nailed it. ________ o | __ | \_ o | |__| | ____/ \ |__ww__| i want nd to win, then to get its faced stomped in. all he has to be is a good pitcher. to make the same money in basketball, he'd have to be great. omg that guy just ate at dos huevos. i think that there's a solid argument that nd is the only team left with a chance to beat kentucky. so, glad it's close for now. meh, i just don't feed it. i compliment win or lose, most people just don't respond or are all, ""heh, thanks."" ""let me eschew advanced statistics to pull some magical number out of my ass."" this guy is real bill simmons material. perfect fit. you know grantland has jumped the shark when some bumbletard is projecting how many days each player will miss. the only consistent team this season is kentucky. arizona and whiskey almost both lost to michigan. i had to buy a diff car the day that we couldn't fit two carriers, my wife, and myself, into the vehicle. well, my first 'new' car, not my first high school/college beaters. those got me from a to b, with some chuckles. hey, plenty of people yolo on their first car. i did! but, that's just me, in my experience, and being totally boring. also, unsolicited advice, maybe out of place. :) my advice for generally anyone would be to wait until your ~30. then see where you are on that sports car. but by that point i was more stable, making more money, etc. just would have been an easier route w/o that first 350z. that being said, i get it. just another perspective. since then, my cars were more practical, not necessarily less expensive. investing in depreciating assets is usually fun, but down the line, ""having about half of that car money now would be nice."" i got my 350z, i loved it, but it was $600/month that i really would have been better off saving. saving for a house, etc. cars are great, driving what you want is awesome. if you have the disposable cash, and aren't in for big life changes, cool! (•_•) &lt;) )╯unsolicited / \ \(•_•) ( (&gt; financial / \ (•_•) &lt;) )&gt; advice / \ i bought tickets for a concert that happens while i'm on vacation. gonna rotate on over there. i bought a   350z, i loved it, drove it for 5 years, it was my bae. also, a poor decision. can i give you 15 reasons to not do that? i suppose. just a play on words. not all martyrs value divinity, they didn't cry. ""world's most beloved"" hyperbole. so much for fact~ thank you. the first reply to this in your thread calls him 'matt' stafford. this disappoints me. jeremy, you have to provide context otherwise i assume it's taco time. :( tough beat, depending on when you bet. oh, honey... they're all corrupt. even your precious pubies. ok, i accept that. :'( no! just making sure you don't think that little of me. :) i hope it's clear that i'm just prodding her. he is not a traitor, he is drugged and acting against his will. there should be no other objectives for our commander-in-chief. bring bowe home. #tcot #ccot yeah, elkenburg park was the place 'to avoid', and any time of day, there was a deal going down. 1 block from the hs. yeah, my hometown still has ""the zone"", which is what we called the ghetto. and the government housing quickly became black, instead of veteran. we had government housing made for war vets, the auto industry brought in production line jobs for the cheap labor. in michigan it was a matter of economics. the low paying jobs with consolidated government housing. there's variety in michigan, but the 'ghettos' are so centralized. you can, literally, identify the 'black' cities. yeah, the majority of the people are black, but the loudest and most accepted voices are racist. crazy. :) imagine that as little as 30 years ago. heck, i grew up in a not-very-accepting place, where the hs was majority black. descirmination is everywhere, it's just a matter of how common it is. why it is where it is, is not as much fun as why it is less pervasive in some places. yeah, the history of discrimination, and why it's found more in certain places, is actually interesting. they can come at me, bruh. more than happy to discuss my opinions based on being a reasonable human. i grew up catholic, about an hour north of south bend. some fucked up people up there, thought things changed. nope. no, actually. that stuff's bullshit - and south bend is celebrating it like it's a good thing. which is a shame, i was liking their game, they have the tools to make a run. hmmm don't think i can really support notre dame, given that the catholic right ar probably the largest supporters of the state's stupidity. that was awesome. ""it's not the soccer mom car, as you would call it."" pleased with this nd win. they've had a very good run down the stretch. can they beat kentucky? probs not. speaking of sprots, this eastern division race to the finish is pretty damn hype. lgrw! the good ole days. man, i loved the bad boys. it was indicated to me today that i don't sports tweet enough. so, here we go: red wings, lions, tigers, who are the pistons? smell. fml, that was good until the typo. the delivery kid didn't notice. that's a normal, almost appealing, small to him. i'll still enjoy it. american hi-fi had at least two decent songs. fuel's entire first album is fire. that's basically what it is, it's called the annual ""summerville"" tour. last year's lineup was damn solid. this one's 'meh'. picked up tickets to see everclear, fuel, and american hi-fi today. 2001 is back! that is disappointing. i thought we were twitter bros. huh. what happened? :( wat that is a very large boa constrictor. killer whales off of new album, lovetap!, is pretty nice. the whole album is nice if you like 'happy' harmonies. need recent album recommendations. halp! i think it was more recently, like during sxsw. i thought they were more pigcar u, must have confused them with unc. hmmmm dunno, which school is umbrellafox u? we got buttslammed. i tried traveling by umbrellafox once. talk about turbulence. ""no flag could be more red"" i mean, hyperbole at its finest. there are tons worse red flags. except for popping women in the jaw. you no follow me no more? :( that timeline is straight freak. you off all week? these kids don't have time for 'a process', you roger goodell or some shit? gogogo their time is right meow! if you're the coach and you go into it with that attitude, you can't expect much from the kids. that shit outcha head, coach. lrt: no chill. jesus christ. rt ouch lol rt lmao preaching to the choir. old man jones. he was all over the 'catch rule' today, needs to be a track. waddup, fam? you see jerry spitting fire today? the director didn't pick james franco for his role first because, ""he wasn't good looking enough."" it is great, absolutely fantastic. 15, 17, 18. and by ""18"" i mean ""eff you that show was awesome."" says the support. rt get gold buy wards save lives #6wordlifegoal you should have sucked it. i was accepted, but i did not go to michigan. i've been a fan since the womb. i think this applies to a very large percentage of d1 football / basketball schools. look man, you had better catch up. we don't just wing it around here, notice was sent. mine blocked, too! that's the best. drank martian soda by advertised as plum, but tastes like what's traditionally called grape. super sweet. 6/10 if that late, let's schedule it asap. working with east coast clients, my lunch is usually 11am. been there, done that, the original. dumbest rule on the books. bad ass. classless. rt in the united states, people from ohio are the most likely to use curse words. stupid matha baka. i trolled the circling dummy! **peers out of the cave** but you can’t has my preciooouuussss. because he has 12 players better than any 5 another can put on the floor. truffle fries, hatch burger, 4 of what you're drinking. and an uber. tyvm 1 year manslaughter sentences are cool, too. waking up a computer from sleep mode is like waking me up: half the shit doesn't work for 5 minutes. ..,? did you just draw a ufo? oh, maybe. it didn’t have any obvious branding. i’ll check on that tomorrow. yeah, it’s the only rocket fizz one i got; i expect to gag. i’m interested in the macfuddy. about 50/50. had to get some novelty for a first run to rocket fizz. now i want to see if this company makes similar novelty sodas - pop culture references. bubble gum flavor, too. lol yeeeeeeep. i just had to get that one in, i found it so funny in the lead-up. people are hilarious. has em turned into a giant succubus yet? everyone said she would. an 'ectoplasm' energy drink! i knew that would catch your eye. rowdy roddy piper in the back, too. nou rocket fizz in the domain. they didn't have sun drop. does live oak market, do you know? the story of c9. finish early or lose. lt: i went and bought some soda today.

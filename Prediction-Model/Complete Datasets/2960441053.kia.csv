25/8 life goodmorning$ that corny nigga on your feed who's always wearing the same fit. the blog is almost finished now, time to follow a million people who i'll probably unfollow after once i see how annoying their useless less knowledgeable tweets are ‚ò∫ i really just enjoy tweeting some wise shit. learn from it honey great minds must be ready not only to take opportunities but to make them. you won't realize it cuz you're still young and have some living to do, but in the future, you'll realize she's the perfect girl for you. remember, ginger rogers did everything fred astaire did, but she did it backwards and in high heels. be respectful to your superiors, if you have any, also to strangers, and sometimes to others. leave dynamite to the low and unrefined. thoughts are energy, and you can make your world or break your world by your thinking. our dreams influence our actions and therefore help form the blueprint of our lives your priorities reflect in the ways you spend the hours of your days. in my dreams, there you are. i'm sure i'm in yours too. history channel on my favs. if your passion doesn't inspire you to study every aspect of it, while you enjoy it, it probably ain't your passion. the turnup was real for yall last night wasn't it? yall stay asleep. dreams on the backboard you're just another insecure mf. i can't deal paints. mus. fash. phot. mac. i gotta get on some other shit now i gotta be the earliest bird i know. me. myself. don't waste time on social networks, a successful life is never done being built nobody cares what you have to say. a person can only define himself not others. if you do the things you need to do when you need to do them, someday you can do the things you want to do when you want to do them rejoice in our confident hope. be patient in trouble, and keep on praying. it's hard in today's society to keep success in its proper perspective and not base our sense of self worth on what we do. make many of your decisions according to their outcome ten years from now. there is no sudden leap to greatness. your success lies in doing, day by day. your upward reach comes from working well and carefully. do not be influenced by the negative views of other people. these females don't want your boyfriend, they want your hapiness. they get confused thinking he's gonna do for them what he does for you. why are girls wearing makeup to the gym though? #gymproblems commitment doesn't guarantee success, but lack of commitment guarantees you'll fall far short of your potential. nothing is more common than unfulfilled potential. our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. the ability to make bold decisions. the desire to commit yourself to taking the time to make your dreams come true. the good sense to pay yourself ten percent, first and always. #business you may delay, but time will not. if we wait for the moment when everything, absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin. not here for the normal. it's all going to take time to build an empire, but i must enjoy the adventure until then. when you start to see who is and ain't shit _ don't let the needle intimidate you, intimidate the needle. what or who i got to prove wrong is not in my path, only one i got to prove is myself. #fwm most of all keep my mouth shut, nobody needs to know anything about what i'm doing when i'm doing it. what for? i hate when people post something saying they keep it so 100 or they so real. stfu. you sound just like everyone else, just show it. i'm so mature. wise, serious. sensible. you determine your future, not a horoscope who thinks all zodiac signs are going through the same thing. horoscopes gotta be the lamest thing you can waste time on everyday. fav my tweets while you lurk now. so ahead of the game scared money don't make money i'm way out your league, please excuse my ego. no. i'm not done. i'm the best, face it. i just don't brag about it, but i very well know it. fill my heart with songs üé∂ i'm so cold, and not like i need a sweater cold i can't stand when someone complains, so i try not to complain myself. self discipline is when you tell yourself to do something and you don't talk back. always have time to squeeze in a workout. i've worked out at least 4 days out of every week in 2014. nothing has changed so far this year i love girls with mean mugging ass faces, but when y'all talk they're so happy and talkative, like yesss, a fem. that's not stuckup, yasss. i guess i should follow more people, to make this twitter bs more live not a successful law firm i know that's right can't stand them bitches on social networks that don't follow back because they think they ""sooo famous"". grow up bitch, you working where? how can a girl be sexually attracted to a boy who sits at home all day and does nothing but watch family guy and shit i can be honest with you now, and you can hate me. or i can lie to you now and you can hate me later. whatever. your choice. i don't want to smoke weed and pop champagne every weekend quite yet, i have no reason to celebrate, i'm still building my success. if you can see your path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it's not your path. your own path you make with every step you take tell them what your going to tell them. tell them. then tell them what you told them. shall i tell you again? you're nothing like me. u may have a pretty face, but still, nothing like me lololol dream your painting, and then paint your dream. sit back &amp; watch the few who do are the envy of the many who only watch.

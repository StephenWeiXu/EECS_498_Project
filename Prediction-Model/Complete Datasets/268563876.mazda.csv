(maybe not exactly this day, but it still happened.) fyi, kids are like pets; nobody gives a shit about yours. rt i think it's neat how republicans have turned science into a liberal conspiracy. hef has a smoking jacket, i have a napping jacket. we're the same. why don't mermaids get to have short hair? just nicked my head shaving for the 3rd time in a row, because apparently i've never done this before. i'm relatively certain that i'm in the 95th percentile when it comes to being classy. you're smart, funny, and beautiful. have a nice day! feels like a pretty great day. the man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life. -muhammad ali is star wars the one with the little wizard boy? rt in focus: ""i'm sorry, but you can't possibly ask me to explain everything god does.” starting to wonder how many times i'm going to have to talk myself out of zingers tonight.

""i wouldn't care for any bacon right now, thank you"". -hitler last chance... i don't think i've ever been this tired in my life before. rt too much of life feels like accidentally stepping into a puddle of water in the bathroom with socks on. everything i need to know in life i learned from doogie howser m.d. i don't like to throw the term ""christmas miracle"" around lightly, but i'm not totally certain that santa didn't build that last nap for me. yay!! begrudging acquiescence!!! i feel alright, but i wonder if i ought to have my thetans checked. rt dasher and dancer and donner and blitzen. comet and cupid and cashew and mittens. i'm not saying they're liars, but i'm always amazed at how many people ""used to"" do awesome things, &amp; ""used to"" make crazy money doing them. i hope the new star wars movie has a scene where even obi wan kenobi can't jedi mind-trick the automatic paper towel dispenser into working. conditioned, yes. but it's never as good. i had a real one today, which was the impetus to this tweet. i will never believe you again about anything if you try to tell me you like diet coke as much as regular. what do you suppose the odds are that i'll end up eating some eggs and bacon today?

leave me alone! rt none of you loves bacon more than the kid from the vegetarian family who slept over at our house last weekend. hero indeed. probably couldn't be more pleased with himself. i don't think i even want to meet the person that would listen to a kathy lee podcast. some of that is just numbers. there's at least 20x as many high school kids playing football as there are college and pros. hey your guys were the ones in red tonight. please make a note of it. as one who discovered in the last year, show's great. i listen to the podcast every day. two words: world-renowned brain surgeon, body of a baby. if you go shopping at any time today, i'll probably judge you. just a heads up. wait, how often do you still talk about the x files?

it's sports. if it's the right thing competitively, it's fair. feel free to check the stats, or rewatch the games. manziel was the best player in cfb last year. if the hmn always went to the best player, winston would have one fewer trophy. it wasn't right last year either. if manziel can't win a second hmn just for being a jerk, neither can jameis. it's how he got his first one anyway. ah crap, it's halloween. hey buddy, i little more don draper, and a little less ed hardy. rt let's just all agree that no adult really needs to tell another adult to smile my goal in life is to one day own something that oprah gifted me. that's hot. it's cold, and there are wolves after me. an empty barrel reverberates the most loudly. you spelled ""shawshank redemption"" wrong. just overheard: ""that's why you want to remain active, so you can continue to go to the bathroom"". its going to be a great day! has anything bad ever ended in ""smothered in brown gravy""? do you find people avoid you at parties? i love this sooooooo much. well done madam secretary. you're not a triple threat, you're a multi-tool. alright, today, you've made your point. i think that's enough. rt your daily horoscope ;-) people who like pie are generally violent. i think maybe the niners ran out of linebackers. my hunch is that its because their coach is moron. ""help, i'm stuck in this box!"" said the mime. wait, mimes don't talk. please disregard. you and me beads. seems we're the only ones. one day, anthropologists will find this picture impossible to accurately date. don't you think those things are mutually exclusive, to a degree? don't get me wrong, i like you. but i'm not in like with you. can everybody please keep talking about how jim harbaugh's players hate him? i loved this just so much. hey, it's just threw out the last hemp necklace i ever made. i'm going to miss you, 1997. of course carolla likes 10,000 maniacs. it's the opposite of those who never disappoint at disappointing. rt books about adhd: who exactly are you for? just heard: ""well then, you've just never had good 'shine."" love me some roosie. we've been doing some furious hand-holding. our palms are raw with desire. rt only 3.4% of americans will vote in the midterm elections. 100% will still complain about the results. #fallonmono with an anchor like chloe, those jenner girls don't stand a chance. careful carolla, you don't want to mess with big zombie. like your stand-up, liked the show. i'm in. it has everything to do with the bengals playing good teams. they're just not that good. the bengals dropping night games has nothing to do with the games being at night. (cont) sometimes i feel just like brad pitt. no hate from me today. they've already won more games this year than i thought they would. rt meet the nfl’s first female measuring chain don't you think that's what all professional artists do? i would just as soon put a steak knife up my nose as watch a twilight movie. i have the strength of a thousand small boys! rt mark davis doesn't get his hair cut, he gets his hair circumcised. #jaymohrsports "

compact, surprisingly weather resistant, widest range of focal length lenses i own, battery lasts forever, 4k movies, timelapse, light canon? familiar, decent image quality, weather sealed, simple to use, but forget fancy stuff like timelapse, no electronic shutter too noisy oh the dilemma. trip to norway (not bondage: holiday) which camera to take?

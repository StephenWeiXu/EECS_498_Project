"sandals! i missed you! bicycle~ i didn't expect to find toad amiibo at target tonight, but there it was! the last one. :0 we can blame for not ffing your account earlier. :v i didn't know you had a twitter! d: i feel kind of bad for not picking out the weeds, because this year they are taking over the yard. don't care enough though! xd but this time it wasn't a lie! ;) didn't quite finish picking up all the leaves. it got too dark, and i couldn't see them anymore. grr! i just want a nice mobile version to view! &gt;3&lt; *crosses fingers* *sees imvu promoted tweet about finding your fursona* it's happening. :v i must really like to cosplay as jerks. c: but how would you get the nose gem to stay in place? :| thinking about how fun it would be to cosplay jasper... :v rt ok well... alrightttttt listen. yards are okay. yards with lots of trees and magnolias are not! i kept seeing bugs crawl out of the leaf compost pile. so much dirt! ew! all i want to do is color pictures tonight, and start packing my library. :3 i didn't finish the yardwork yesterday, because of leaf apocalypse. so, front yard tonight. t__t (save meeeeee....!) time to pick up the leaves for yardwork. :'( rest in peace, eyeball... ugh, i got to pay that doctor bill. i'm never using them again! who knows what they'll secretly charge me next time. 9______9 i think spring happened...*uses entire box of tissue* maybe now we'll get a phone browser version of fa? just sayin'. imvu now owns furaffinity? i did not see that coming... :v i am so thankful that the house included all other appliances! it was just an art card. not much to this one. bought a washer/dryer last night. i'm going to be paying it off over the next 12 months. .___. not sure what i want for lunch today, but that sounds so good. i know those feels. :| i'm glad we got a house though. you don't have to worry about the noise level with thin walls. cool! we're moving in on the 13th! it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't 1100 sqft with no locks on the doors. what is personal space? the old house needs to be fixed on the inside, because i don't want to live there when it is in chaos. i'm supposed to get the old house after they move, but they have been saying that for the last 6 years. actually, yes. :( this is pretty much how i feel. everytime i take a big step they want to throw all these doubts at me. it sucks. it's not like he made me wait for anything important for 6 years, and now i'm supposed to take it seriously? dad was not happy that i was renting a house. rt furcons landing on pay day got me like: i'm not going to say anything! that's just too bad! :3 i'm pretty much done listening to my mother's bulligerent attitude about my two future roommates showing public displays of affection. i'll be bugging for sure! the best boxes come from liqueur stores. not going to lie about that one. new place to live secured! will be moving immediately after fwa. i need to start finding boxes... i have to scan all my badges now in case they get lost in the mail. :( they canceled the potluck, but now i have all these eggs. .___. *pretends to be a fox* :v thank goodness i'm orange. where have you been all my life, garment maker? ;__; shoop da woop swagger swaggity swag. 8d got approved for the rental house! just have to go sign the papers and hand over the money! *adds packing to long to-do list* .___. i'd do it saturday, but that's my 18-mile bike ride. there's no way i could muster the extra strength at that point! i have to set aside one afternoon this week to do yardwork after getting off work. no, it's too soon! =__= remember to wear green today! i'm wearing my favorite attack on titan t-shirt. &gt;:3 i keep finding dead copics in my box... *shoves them off to the side* oh noes! i have to chaperone my child on the internet! the horror. d: bless these posts~ i think the less i know about gamergate the better. xd spark spark lightning storm luxray! kind of like laying out pieces of fabric that you cut out before sewing them together. it's a little side widget in 3ds max that let's you make clothes out of line drawings. because poly modeling clothes over a body takes too much time!!! it looks so fake to me now without the blemishes. i'm going to attempt learning garment maker in 3ds max tomorrow to go with my newfound cloth simulation knowledge. who drew the bottom left one? :v Â¿lo quieres? pretty much shocked about getting cloth simulation to work! no waaaay! such a huge step as a generalist. yessssh! rt lupin iii: the castle of cagliostro blu-ray releasing on april 28 it was okay. why you got to leave songs out of the movie though, and only put them in the credits? :( i wanted to, haha! my first character test was with a ghost costume, so thanks for that recommendation. everyone looks spooky! d: everyone gets a ghost costume!!! it took forever just to figure out how to get the plane to collide with the box, and not fall into infinite 3d world space. derp derp derp. i can't believe i figured out cloth simulation in 3ds max! now if only i could apply it to clothing and not just tablecloths. it really crept up on me! .___. can we watch part 1, too!? :3 i'll send them straight to shade court. i'm done playing. my friends started some drama and want to make me a mediator. no, keep me out of it, and figure it out like adults. whoa, so hawt~ new icon time! *__* got really excited about watching frozen fever last night! there was also this movie attached to it. :v i'm not sure. it happened really fast. d: *rubs eyes* did i just see brandy make a cameo in cinderella 2015? rt season three - april 5th #chinail i like my   corrola. wish i got darker seats though. :v i'm not going to render avi again on this machine. just pngs and put them together later. the joys of 3d managed to fix it by re-plugging everything again. but it lost my render, so i have to start all over again! :') time to troubleshoot. hopefully i can fix this problem. i didn't even get to look at my renders! the render killed my computer. &gt;:c hahahaha! *stabbity stab i can be easily amused! &gt;3&gt; i'm halfway to my donation goal for tour de cure! will be practicing again tomorrow morning. i miss talking to you! t__t that moment when you see call someone out! 8d you got my attention! i should try to pick up zbrush again. i find the gui very intimidating. should just suck it up and deal with it. sculptris seems like a good tool to lay out organic shapes. however, not good for anything mechanical or extravagantly detailed. do you got cvs? i know they do them. inspiration~ :3 yeah, i got into it! i wanna see gem world! .__. ka-ka-rose! so, we meet at last... *retweeting when it features my badge art eeeeeeee* :3 rt here is collared. #fursuitfriday suddenly, garnet's talk with steven about fusion being an experience makes me die a little inside. &lt;/3 waaaaaaaaah garnet's song! ;//__//; rt celestia in gray tones! lousy photo... all the bulbs in this hotel are yellow! rt #pokemonshuffle #megaglalie its so hard :'d got a 92% catch rate yesterday and still failed. i guess that's statistics for ya. i've been going back trying to catch my missing ones. mega glalie is tough. catching ivysaur in pokemon shuffle is impossible! how do? 9__9 yeah, it's about 3 minutes a frame! *abandon all hope* i wonder how long it will take my computer to render 325 frames? .___. this is the first time i actually made anything. everything before was just carving into the sphere doing random patterns. i made an orca! the basic shape with the extrudes and everything. not exactly a work of art, but just testing the settings. i can use sculptris now! this is going to take a lot of practice to get sufficient... every house has its own faucet puzzle... i applied for a rental property this morning with my friends. hope we get approved! so broken. i love it. i wonder what happens when it gets removed? :v nope! mmmm stadiums... gonna be working on art tonight. next week! learning mixamo fuse! i'm impressed so far! nice 3d character editor/builder, and it can rig your work. #3dtalk operation color everything commenced! i'm just going to be an emotional blabbering mess all day from canceling the house offer. dad's making promises he can't keep. i hope he proves me wrong. ugh, i'm going to be sick. i don't want to turn this house down if it means another broken promise. i didn't have any leg pain from biking, but my upper body didn't want to have anything to do with me. that's just weird. finally, feeling better today. all weekend it has been shoulder pain and sniffles. had to just sleep it off. 9__9 don't touch the springs! &gt;3&gt; caught up with steven universe comics! yeah yeah! i was going to do a lot of stuff tonight, but my body is like, ""hahaha no. go lay down and think about what you have done."" i don't think i'd be in so much pain if i didn't wipe out on my bike earlier... &lt;:c mmmmm more evening sunlight. come to me! i'm buying a house! xd tomorrow, i'm biking along the beach for training. gonna be so nice~ #soouttapractice technically coffee. *hugs no, puppy! feel better soon! rt #mlpseason5 debuts april 4th! let the hype begin!!!! honestly, i don't think they'll do anything, but i'm sure they talk! &gt;__&gt; if they want to throw me out because i went to a gay bar with some friends, then they got a serious problem. witnessing this got me all...oooooooh! i'm sensing some bad vibes. got a warning from a relative to be careful about supporting lgbt while housesitting, because the owners are against it/judgemental. scheduled closing date for the house is the day after fwa. *falls over* rt this is definitely true for just about any id software game. ðŸŽ® ðŸ’» that's so exciting! gotta jump on the ps4 bandwagon now! please let me get a return...*crosses fingers* going to sign some disclosure papers and file taxes today. #toomuchadult =__= my high school had a mat cutter. honestly, took me a few times to perfect the technique. might be worth it. printer, why can't you print black only if the colors are low? it's like it holds all your pending jobs for ransom. &gt;:c #hpprinter rt gunner rosalina, at your service! fuuuuu...:( oh, that's why mine goes to credit card. i hate paying big bills with checking. 9__9  he said his looks probably scare away a lot of customers, so was just thinking how we could help out. we have a close friend who does realistic pencil work, but he doesn't like to do booths because he's this huge, intimidating guy. i was talking to aira about making our own guild for pensacon with a couple of other artist friends. kind of pull all our talents together. i have waaaaaaay too many appointments scheduled this week. let's get everything done at once never again. house inspection, why u so $$$?! pretty good incentive to go! what brings you to sarasota? hoping to get everything done tonight, but we'll see how that goes. i'll probably skip gaming tomorrow night. i have to get ready for filing my taxes. :| my father didn't have a positive reaction to my house buying news, but i knew that was coming. :| i want no meddling in my affairs! my mother keeps wanting to get my father involved in the house buying process, and i am just like ehhhhhhhhh no. game night at my new place? :v i'm letting my friend paint the blue room to something more earth tone, and we're going to build a screened patio. can i move in now? *knock knock* :d house is mine! got to hand over the deposit, get the place inspected, and secure a loan. *__*  i love my green cheek! ""can i lick your face, ryuko?"" :9 i put in an offer... rt roses are red, violets are blue, i'm going to try and buy a house!!! i've started the process and found a place. *__* #dowant bleh. i feel you. i do things with my mother, but my dad hasn't gone out of his way to get together. i am just so mad...this one thing fucks everything up. but she's an elderly lady with a gay and lesbians living upstairs. so, you see how that works. =__= my roommates got a notice that they cannot renew their lease, because of complaints from a downstairs neighbor about ""noise."" at this point, i think apartment living is out of the question. if we get turned down here, there is no way we qualify for anything else. yay! i really needed some good news! rt someone hold me: lumberjanes' noelle stevenson is reviving #runaways for marvel brain, what are you doing to my eyes?! ahh! i see both colors! .__. it was this 100-year-old house we went to see today, but it was a dump. like a little kitten for adoption. draw over it with black lines to make it baymax. ;3 i'm sad about the casper house. just wasn't for us. the best part about it was the pet cat! did not come with the house though. we finally all agreed on a place to rent! i'll just be living there by myself for most of the month until their other lease is up. ;__; i can't believe i got a pre-order spot for gold mario!? *rubs eyes in disbelief* rt gold mario preorder now live! they need to pay what they owe!!! bring it on, casper!

"so says wrestlemania is #cool but bachelor party with mj, tom brady, and company is #notcool? wat? ""why does a future-hof, mvp-caliber, super bowl winning qb, get treated different than meeeeeeeee!!!!!"" wow. i had no idea that was such a cry baby. oh i realize it, but you're still tweeting about it! says the guy who was tweeting about ultimate frisbee 10 hours ago. the principal at school is your pal, that's why it ends that way. you're welcome. rt retweet this and the #nba and will plant a tree with #nbagreen yhore i want to find a way to use your terrible tweets as a form of renewable energy. yes, i want to kill em who reads that and thinks ""she wants to kill babies and burn their bodies for energy!!!""?!?!? i guess there is if your audience is too slow to figure out what was meant by it. has rats!! i found a whole rat in my cobb salad!!! sorry, but that was hot rod. i still hate fisher more.

""getting thrown into headlock? that's a foul!"" - refs per ""teams in that building were 12-57 from behind the arc today."" venue kinda screwed the utes tonight, didn't it? i wanna see the tickets of the patsy betting on the ref's behalf. the big 12 was so bad that byu fits right in ..."" this works too.. rt i think more to do with the venue than winslow. teams in that building were 12-57 from behind the arc today. i think there is a chance that utah will be even better next year despite losing delon (unless poeltl declares). not too take anything away from delon but utah will likely get better shooting from his replacement next yr &amp; chapman will start over reyes thank you for an amazing season, can't wait to see the run you make next year. #goutes you guys hitting your parlay? lol, good one, hans. especially after refusing to call the jump ball that wright had tied up for 3 seconds. utes go down swinging. entertaining game, especially finish. can't wait for next year. #lighttheu #lightthedamnu lol the refs refuse to call that jump ball but they demand that duke shoots these pointless free throws? #ruckfefs is chapman replacing reyes a bigger upgrade than i. wright replacing delon is a downgrade? whether or not they pull off the miracle i love the fight from utah. fighting to the bitter end. #goutes such a ticky tack foul at this point of this game. down to 8... you can do this utah!!!!! there's still time... you can do this utes!! he's the token ""sucks at basketball but hustles and plays hard on defense"" guy that people in utah love. reyes does stupid stuff. why is reyes ever in a game at any level? if utah's tips and ""in and out"" shots actually went down rather than bouncing out they would be up by 17. never seen so many shots go in and come back out. lol when do you ever see that ""travel"" called? he played in the first half. loveridge 3 goes in and then back out, then refs blow a charge call on the other end. huge swing right there. how many tips can you miss at the rim!?!?!? couldn't shoot and wright was robbed away by a ref, yet utes only trail by 5? that's okay by me. utes will pull this one out. bach is in though. that's some bush league bullshit by winslow right there. everything, absolutely everything, has gone wrong and utah is only down 7. that's okay by me. that was a bad call, finally the utes get one. utes were able to beat georgetown playing 8-5, but probably can't do the same against a team like duke. absolute horseshit to see a game of such magnitude changed by a ref. absolutely inexcusable bullshit. excuse my language but in what fucking world is that a foul!? utes can't shoot right now and they're only down 4? that's a win in my book. utes win by 7. make sure you let me know who wins the scrimmage. adjusting to the background takes time and effects your shot. have fun at the spring football scrimmage. i'll just be here watching the #sweetsixteen ""hey, let's take teams in the sweet sixteen and make them adjust, on the fly, to shooting in a dome!!"" probably. utes doubling up duke! #fukeduke can't let do his hots impression any more. i'll crash my truck being blinded by tears. damn it... i'm legitimately depressed now... this news ruined my night. i just got a text from a friend... did we really lose hot rod? dearest i logged roughly 34 hours over the last 3 days. i need a good start to this weekend. hook me up. tia, me rt no matter what happens tonight it's been an awesome season.great wins good times. happy with the season. thanks utes.n… rt ""good luck to our brothers tonight! #utefamily #goutes #sweetsixteen #beatduke i think it is funny that, after years of mocking soccer and saying no one cares about it, now has to pretend to care. you say: ""dustin, it's only 7:45."" i say: ""screw you, i'm going to bed anyways."" #oldmanproblems rt when i asked coach whitt about the battle for the number 2 qb he told me not to count chase out of the mix. nobody runs as fast as i do when i am running to clock out to avoid filling out a 12 hour dot log. feels me, right? who wants to party? i might take you up on that whenever i buy the material. remember when haws tried to go behind his back but delon stole it and said ""lemme show you how that done."" and dunked? #goodtimes i'm in sandy, where you can't dig more than 6"" without hurting a rock... so that'll be fun. wife did some research today and they were one of the best options, in her opinion. i need a hookup for a vinyl fence company. any advice or ? i have a no trade clause, sucka. barney's movie had heart, but ""football in the groin"" had a football in the groin. if i don't save the wee turtles, who will!? if they don't want to pay i'll move the fence 2"" back, so it's on my property, and paint ""his"" side neon pink. the owners behind me rent out the house so i doubt they're going to be excited about renovations. two of his hosts said that opposing teams should leave j-love open because he can't shoot. #clueless how horrible is the ""we need to replace our shared fence, you're paying for half of it, right?"" neighbor discussion? well that's dumb. utes always have better ______ what are we pissing over? dear i'm not going to follow you just because you keep following/unfollowing me. stop being a douche. thanks. for what? the great burger debates again, huh? salt city burgers and habit... if you go elsewhere, that sucks for you. my wife is taller than me. so there's that. is there actually such a thing as fantasy mls? lol in my experience, your personal beliefs and passions have no basis on your looks or sexual preference. remember when utah beat georgetown, playing 5 on 8, to reach the #sweetsixteen? #goodtimes #fukeduke why? what would be the point of that? nah. they need to experience winning now. they don't need another young player. i seriously doubt it. i fell asleep. how much was duke up when you inquired? rt psst, psst: wanna know a secret? utah has the perfect d to stop duke. also, delon wright on the pick and roll is a nightma… a team that defends as well as sdsu is never out of a game at halftime. it's not over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no. you can't yet. it's not over. then no, you can't say it is over yet. but it is still the first half? is it still the first half? no. didn't learn our lesson yesterday about games not ending in the first ten minutes, huh? come on #suckdogstate, make proud so that utah can create more local media member tears!!! #djtears movies were better when sang their music. stop giving that usu fan attention. it was obvious long ago that it's just a troll account. lol sfa rt it’s great that tom izzo got over his crippling sensitivity to electromagnetism utah isn't losing until they meet kentucky and probably not even then so, bring on whoever!!! byu disagreed after their gonzaga game too.. who do we want? #suckdogstate or #dook ? this game is the worst thing ever!!!! i feel like a failure... but those 3 s'mores were delicious! i tapped out after 3 s'mores, friends. #skinnypeopleproblems 1 s'more down, 15 to go. #sweet16smores damn.... okay... but at least my secret of being the north end zone girl is still safe. as long as no one finds out that i'm the #stadiumpooper to be fair... you did want to be wrong. i'm sorry that i have nipple bombed your timelines in my post game celebratory shenanigans. i will move on and learn from this mistake. no way. my manliness is defined by my diamond shaped chest pubes. i did the same when byu scored to breast oklahoma. you'll get over the sickness and back to the hate. rt i just jumped up and cheered that brandon taylor 3. i feel sick two!? i must've blacked out after the first one. guys... reyes made a lay up tonight!!!!! #fukeduke #suckdogstate either way... #elite8bound i would've waited until they understood english. rt my bracket is still alive. i believe. #uteproud yep. and i remember when they'd lose to g-town because of how badly they played sfa. good point. you bring those. celebration fire. celebration s'mores soon to come. they'll taste sweet. sweet sixteen!!! ohhhhhhhhh!!! remember said utah would lose in the first round because no team could overcome that oregon loss? #goodtimes i'll be having a fire and beer in my backyard tonight. you're welcome to join. i won't talk about the game. lol jump ball? utes got this one, baby!!!! #sweetsixteenbound !!!! i was going to ask if ""d in the key"" want a rule in college. rt josh smith commits an illegal screen, travels, and is going to the line. they'd just call a charge. rt apparently if you're a giant fat guy, you can do whatever you want to the other team in college basketball. must've missed t… lol. how many of smith's 21 fouls have they actually called? you don't get to complain about refs. sure, that was all ball trawick except for your hip demolishing bach's back. tubby smith has no fouled out twice... refs just haven't called any of them. refs are letting him move on his screens, smash his belly into drivers, and shove anyone he wants to. rt that can't be a foul. the officials have been fairly consistent, but i do wish they would let more go tonight. that was… you can't get passed a screen when the refs let someone that fat take 3 steps sideways while he is setting his screen. these refs are just letting tubby smith push and shove anyone he wants, aren't they? nova lost? #welp lol so did i. that one over b-tay on their last miss was blatantly obvious. lov33ridge!!! trawick blown away by the most obvious call of the game thus far. no foul called on any of these three. all in two min span this is embarrassing to see. #pac12refs showed up for those last two possessions, huh? b tay right in your damned face!!!!!! back to back missed fouls by these refs. i want to play basketball for ron hunter. tied at the half with how georgetown shot to start the game? might as well call out nite, utes win. kuuuuuz go spend two hours at in-n-out. i'll buy, send me the bill. rt utes are starting to defend with toughness and great attention to detail. and 1 by peoltl.....utes are heating up utes lead!!!!!!!!!# "

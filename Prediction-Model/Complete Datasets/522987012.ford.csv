"dude, back to clarks they go!! saying that, i'm deffo going for some better rears on the z3, front grip is great but rear can step out at speed don't go for the softest / highest grip, you'll chew them up in 5 minutes! i'm on a bus. first time in... 15 years?? the cost is terrible, the ride appalling, but it's stillâ€¦ crap tyres are brilliant. the firestones i had on the capri lasted ages, smoked and spun every day. no grip tho. lift off oversteer is not ideal, you may be trying to reduce speed when the tail snaps out. prefer power slides ðŸ˜ƒ you spun the punto? what were you thinking?? i spun the 911 a few times, largely in loose surfaces, just for fun! prepare for your first spin! understeer sucks cock. that said, my 2.8ltr   capri was pretty damn funny. tail sliding round every corner on grip free firestones. i don't think rear drive is a guarantee of driving pleasure. biggest grin i ever had was in a peugeot 205gti 1.9 not driven a powerful road 4x4, my most powerful car was a 911, not sure how 4wd would feel in fast corners. hot cross buns, slathered in butter, black coffee... mighty fine breakfast! #hotcrossbuns #breakfastâ€¦ are people crying and throwing flowers around? i never quite know with jeremy clarkson, so much of the show is set up, i now question every topgear headline. argentina, now scuffle. real? erm, someone may need a sticky plaster! a bsa 350cc combo, but the happy little dog, wearing doggles (yes that's a real thing) steals theâ€¦ mmmm, chin scratch heaven! #mainecoon #cat #happy not the most romantic of settings but the first time i've had the guzzi out this year. mot complete,â€¦ rt this week in religion or not of. bloody spewl chocker!! they're multiplying!!! i didn't feed them after midnight of anything... #beer #beeroclock #happy john has beer too. this is good. #beer #beeroclock cheeky leffe, pretending to be a franziskaner!! deceptive bugger. #beeroclock #leffe #happy did you sign it? or was the person local, so they could see you marking your territory? was it a polite note? jura vs glenfiddich... but which one is best? there's only one way to find out... #jura #glenfiddichâ€¦ and now you know why some people park like tossers and take up two spaces! bm or alf? watching pale rider on itv4. must have seen it a dozen times or more but it's still great. clint eastwood is brilliant. #clint #western just to say, ya gran was in good spirits, fit and well. still won't come up to see us in hitchin though ;) ðŸ˜ƒ was it by being in a car rather than a wobbly bicycle? this is all utterly normal for a county council. for it to be otherwise would be unnerving. lovely daffodils for st david's day bringing a touch of spring to molly's tea room #hitchinâ€¦ no worries. we'll do the honours! going down to london this evening to visit your grandma. today i slept till 10:45. that'll do me as a good reason to love a sunday. in the bmw i take it? i'm with you there. are you sure that isn't sprouts? not a bad show that, a decent amount of conversation with both. yummy chocolate cake, with cadbury's chocolate buttons on top!! what could be better?? #cakeâ€¦ this is now mishka's handbag! #cat #handbag #buffoon dear madonna, did you learn nothing from the incredibles? #madonna #nocapes #theincredibles #brits2015 disagree. more of the cheeky leffe fella, here goes wednesday!! #beer #beeroclock #leffe happy! #beeroclock #beer #leffe was he of the romany persuasion? he? what's the point of that? topless clothes wise or roof wise? exciting times! cheeky brahma beer in chiquito stevenage. very pleasing. #beeroclock #chiquito #texmex haven't done this in ages... chiquito for a tex mex lunch! nachos and fajitas here we come. #stevenageâ€¦ that front end is horrible. the design is unimaginative, uninspiring, plain even. it looks dull to me. power is great but it just ain't sexy dropped into molly's tea room for a proper cuppa!! marvellous. #mollystearoom #nicecupoftea #hitchin but to be strong, he needs us to buy his gas and oil. a little war here and there won't do him any harm. in the west we have been guilty of thinking russia is a spent force. putin wants to show the world russia is still strong. nah, he's not interested in nuking us. we are his customers. he's interested in expending russia, for more gas sources nah, it's not that bad, but the environment may have hit a tipping point, so tinned foods and a machete for protection! just bought a boards of canada album - tomorrow's harvest. like bathing in warm custard. #boardsofcanada #beautifulmusic #electronica #yum is it wheels? i think they could be useful. then i will sleep soundly. whassup? nearly all seated... alarmingly close to the front! #mostlycomedy #hitchin #arthursmith mostly comedy, a hitchin. arthur smith tonight. #hitchin #mostlycomedy it's me!! using the camera thrills on twitter!! #photo #selfie #moustache #moustacheclub #nicecupoftea understandable. footy fans being fuckwits... bit odd! solid stick is your answer. damn right. got through to lloyds from work, looks like some internet/bank fraud occurring. lloyds fraud dept on it. also i'm trying to log in to my on line banking using my phone app and its rejecting the three characters from memorable info they are addressed to me and look very real. the numbers are: 08456040440 &amp; 084530000000 are you guys experiencing some issues? i just got 3 emails for a loan i didn't apply for, can't log in and phone numbers dead cheeky little squiggle loves peanuts... from a bird feeder. #squirrel #nuts #garden #pergola on the plus side, at least you got out of the parking ticket. winning. still shit that you should have to stump up at all. Â£108 sounds pretty decent. that kind of thing is enormously annoying though. what a sack of shit that driver was. dunno how much they charge, but worth a look. had a friend with an audi tt, the wing got badly crumpled in a scrape. by the time those guys were done, perfect. they have weird little panel smoothing tools and can smooth out these kind of things very effectively. these are the sort of folks: on the rear door panel? tedious, but doesn't have to cost a mint. those sort of dents can usually be fixed with replacing panels. they have clever bendy tools that enable them to smooth out balls. could you ask at work, if anyone knows who that van belonged too? sounds about right... any clue as to what van? that's a considerable ding, did it happen at home? is that your car? black swan is on our telly... about the same as being asleep! stay up, watch shit on tv. cobblers. we fade to grey: #stevestrange #visage #sadnews how much did they quote you. suspension fixed? hello cheeky! a little craft beer from cafe rouge. very pleasing. #beeroclock #beer #caferouge that's beautiful. ooh, was it good? in china? describe in 145 characters. you have the strangest memory! she did fuck all you know. that's annoying did she win? he went to argentina and told them that they should get the faulkland islands... monumental tosser. i'm with you on that one. the man is a special case. does this look super bleedin eerie or what? #snow #nightgarden #midnight #spooky the word you seek is ""crema"". that is the froth of the oils released from the beans: may i suggest a wash perhaps? the basket, on the way out a hideous prison, now looks like a cosy snuggle box! #mainecoon #cat #grumpy mishka is less than impressed with his visit to the vet... maybe it's the discovery that he's put on aâ€¦ tidying the tools back into the shed after the months of labouring in molly's tea room. cold out, but good work. #shed #winter that's how buying and selling works! you want the most, they want to pay the least. only ever buy it on knock down. waitrose had it for 2 squids! you've made it wrong... why is it brown? ah. yum. toaster? ever noticed how sweetcorn never gets digested? that. beer. the croft in hitchin, serves hand made beers by freedom. yum. #thecroft #beeroclock #freedomâ€¦ millie visits molly's as a vip guest! #mollystearoom #tea #hitchin we've popped a new/old photo into the washroom... a limited edition print of a classic mercedes byâ€¦ another lemon drizzle... but this one is gluten free!! there may be a taste test needed here :)â€¦ molly's fresh lemon drizzle cake is selling fast!! #mollystearoom #yum #tearoom #cake if you haven't been on this site, i'll be amazed. looks right up your ally: fluffy and real dogs are welcome at molly's tea room!! they'll need to be well behaved and not bigâ€¦ nice cup o'tea, that's what you need. ha ha i can't stop giggling at this. never call your child clint. best cake ever!! gluten free chocolate brownies are go!! freshly made and ready to devour ðŸ˜ƒ #mollystearoom #tearoomâ€¦ overated. what is the group name for tea pots, a plethora? a huddle? a brewed? #mollystearoom #tearoom #teaâ€¦ council tax, always a pleasure. and what do you get for that money? you need to stop watching celebrity big brother! ha ha! welcome to a world of cute cosies and pictures of cake!! hi kate, are you following ? i've yet to link my instagram to that account, but it's getting better. a decided lack of cake and tea pots cosies, but nonetheless a handy addition to molly's tea room -â€¦ thank leffe it's friday!! #beer #beeroclock #sunrunner #hitchin when i did that i quizzed the guy loads in advance &amp; made it clear that his description needed to be accurate. which it was. i bought my suzuki sv1000s from edinburgh, flew up on easyjet, did a test ride, bought it and rode home. ticket was Â£50. the choice is your sunshine. i still recommend the z3 :) 4 is cheaper to run/maintain but the 6 sounds lovely, is inherently smoother. diesel is for taxis and tractors damn straight. i don't see you nabbing many sales from bmw, merc and audi but good luck with it. as you say, each to their own. i'm not saying it should be more of a boy racer with spoilers and such, just that the overall design is lazy. conservative. sorry, you've got some nice photography there, but that car looks bland. i hate that front grill and the back is drab. i shall ask fluff for an estimate when you say front upper wishbones, do you mean that they need to be replaced or just the bushes on them? if you let me know what needs doing i'll ask fluff how much and how long. it can't be all the shocks at the same time... is it just the bushes? yikes do you still not have enough cash to sort yours out? little horrors. angry, at a christian? i think there are a lot worse things than that... only if we let him - with your mums merc we were happy to leave it for a while. then you must flog your and buy his with moneys. is it worth asking fluff? have you found someone to do your shocks on the cheap? that looks bang tidy for 280k miles that's disappointing. i was sure you'd go for one of those little beauties! what has tickled you? is it a smart four2? i like a shiny new car, but toyota with their new lexus have produced a steamer. what a vile front end and boring car the new nsx is worse. bland, from a bland car maker... zzzzzz how on earth do you make a supercar boring... easy, make it honda. made for elderly: this beard talk is freaky. molly's chocolate brownies relaxing for a moment before they get devoured!! #mollystearoom #chocolateâ€¦ i notice that the dog doesn't get much of a look in either... just an occasional hind leg!! he is? when did this happen?? #greyhound you should move ;) no quite so convenient eh? another shabby chic shelf arrives at molly's tea room. must bring some more decorative plates and teaâ€¦ ain't that the truth! happy little black squiggle, munching on nuts. #squirrel #hitchin can't believe you eat rustlers... that's worse than pot noodle!! is that the maccy d? latest addition to molly's tea room adventure in interior design. a touch more shabby chic thanâ€¦ chocolate brownies are lovely and moist, but it's the coffee &amp; walnut cake that's selling fastest!â€¦ what, a bit chewy? topgear is the saviour of useless chrimbo tv. now watching 2 headed shark attack - which is amazing. that's a reasonable description. i think she wants to portray herself as an intelligent lady. she is neither. boom. richard ayoade is great. mel b - not so much. mishka paw. #cat #mainecoon hello christmas day drinkies! yummy. #beer #spitfire #beeroclock obviously it should say ""molly put the kettle on..."" but it's close enough! #mollystearoomâ€¦ 20 oz cÃ´te de boeuf at hermitage rd last night... absolutely gorgeous beef. great company, top food.â€¦ i've had that before, cheeky sods eh? who/how? taste it, then send it back saying that it's corked! aiming for a boutique feel in the washroom, still old but more a pastiche than directly 1940s. #1940sâ€¦ ooh, fresh coffee and walnut cake at molly's tea room. lovely. #mollystearoom #cake #nicecupoftea #coffee a lovely light lunch in molly's tea room, hitchin #mollystearoom #hitchin #nicecupoftea real china, real tea pot. #mollystearoom #lovelycupoftea #hitchin indeed, where's the gun toting loonies from america to blast their way to freedom? you have misunderstood him. bmw z3, just cleaned, ready for that sunset shot. #bmwz3 #z3 #boystoys must be 7 guys here, working like crazy. very impressed with the effort and work ethic.

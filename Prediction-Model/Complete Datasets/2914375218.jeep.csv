right. blame all of this on me. because it's /all/ my fault. *he shook his head for seemed - - anxiously fiddle with his fingers.* fine. you've made yourself clear. for jackson, right? *he purses his lips together in a tight thin line, leaning back against the couch before beginning to - - would you? are you breaking up with me, or not? - with me, doesn't make any sense. and then..you're breaking up with me to basically be with jackson. just get to the point - then...what i don't get; is the fact that you think i treat you like absolute trash. and the fact that you're still happy - - sarcastically with a roll of his eyes.* - me, are you? that's okay. i get it. i'm a shit boyfriend. it's not like jackson will be any better. *he says - so..what you're saying is that you've been acting all this time? /you're/ the one that's not happy. you're not happy with - - before sitting back down on the couch beside her, staring down towards the ground.* i didn't mean it. okay? i didn't freaking mean it. *he runs his hands through his hair, getting rather agitated by now - - you. i'm not..happy with malia or anyone else. - it's you. it's always been you. *he brings his fingernails to his lips, nervously biting down on them.* i'm happy with - i don't even /like/ malia. she's just a friend. i don't see her like i see you. i freaking /love you/. i don't love her. - - be. you don't know how much it'll /hurt/ me. i will legitimately be scarred for life. and ""for life"", is a long time. - they're signs of /happiness/. i'm happy with you. but, if you dump me to just..run off to him. i'm not. and i never will - i don't treat you like trash and i /do/ smile when i'm with you. i smile all the time. 24/7. and they're not fake smiles. - - hand.* i'm sorry, i just..go. go and..run off to him. - his voice and only noticed after he had finished yelling his lungs out. he quietened down, rubbing his forehead with his - and you didn't /tell me/?! so it's him, isn't it?! it's always gonna be him and it's never going to be /me/. *he had raised - - control his breathing.* - words came out quickly. too quickly. his took in a deep breath and just folded his arms across his chest, trying to - why? is there someone else? someone better than me? oh my god..is it jackson? you're going back for him, aren't you? *his - - but fine. break up with me. lets see how long it lasts. - wouldn't have anyone else for the world. *he shook his head and slammed the cushion onto the couch before standing up.* - what? just like that? because you think i'm not happy with you? are you serious? i've waited for you since third grade. i - - *he says, his tone sarcastic as he rolls his eyes once again, shaking his head.* - corner and cry your eyes out?

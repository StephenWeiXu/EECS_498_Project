"man, usagi yojimbo - grasscutter is the shit! such an amazing book! it's ok :p one of my exes was nicknamed nikki -- yup, sounds about right! nicky then? thinking of selling my lumberjanes #1 thru 8, ms. marvel #1 thru 5 and dark cybertron #1 thru 12 as bundles. she has serious spunk! that zettai ryouiki! i told you to stop overlseeping! that fluttershy! paula deen's not so secret ingredient for everything? *gakuran, not bakuran and maybe even smoking and yoyos, because yoyos can be weapons according to hs delinquent anime all totally banchou, and one of them wears a bakuran, and someone else a mohawk =p fluttershy has to be the one with the face mask, nailbat and the long skirt. every time i see someone use bae to refer to their so, i can't help but to picture such so as a pile of danish poop. yeah, but there's millennials and there's millennials. i'm probably among the oldest millennials are those bad co-workers... millennials? grrrr &gt;=( gonzaga, you've failed me. oh wow... shit =/ i think the title i am the most interest from the upcoming secret wars is x-men 92. need to purge my ipad... i got 40 gigs of comics. not that rivera was bad, but i think mark waid's run on daredevil really came to jell once samnee got on the book. i don't like spider-man. i've always been more of a daredevil kind of guy. i hope my friends feel that way about me. it's ok dude, just giving you a hard time :p well... f1 race is over, back to sleep! ah man, didn't know my f1 talk would make you unfollow me. =p hamilton becomes a whiny little bitch whenever he's not in 1st place. #malaysiagp #f1 that i agree meh, some cosplayers are full of it, but that's because some people are just full of it regardless of what they are. he does give superman a run for his money in kingdom come i hate those kind of assholes. i'll say it again. josuke is a terrible jojo, and diamond is unbreakable is shit. rt new releases for april 1st - rt not at #eccc? no worries! rt this for a chance to win this exclusive #rebels patch! ‚Ä¶ link? you need to do more art, even if its just sketches! i really envy everyone that is at eccc ;__; more excited for steins gate 0 than i am for chaos child. =p i'm sorry, your feeling i can't feel deeply. i don't like diamond is unbreakable. josuke is the worst jojo to have ever jojo-ed. omg, that cute cherno alpha! =( i wanna see that betty/veronica pic finished! wish i was at eccc ;__; i know, right? &gt;=( i shall sneak into your basement and break your pipes! rt you're oppressing our religious freedom #boycottindiana  yeah, the citizens united thing was a clusterfark. tho i tend to find scalia and thomas as more abhorrent than roberts i hate adoptables g'luck at eccc! maybe it turns stuff into pyrite and not actual gold. he came back in the comics, as an alien clone. interesting concept! gotta love how completely ignores dr. vera peters, the doctor that actually did the legwork to prove lumpectomies as viable. =( only reason i get spring break is because i work for a school that's what it meant to most of my buds in college =/ other than drinking at the beach and doing lewd things? i saw the headband, which is why i thought gwen looks like gwen =o where are you? =o now i wanna see if i can parlay my luck into getting a prius as well. yeah! i'm gonna pay less with the new mortgage &amp; finish faster. o__o lobo the duck was the only good thing that came out of that i'll be signing my new mortgage today! shaving 6 1/2 yrs off of the previous loan. =p rt rt to show indiana gov &amp; presidential hopeful mike pence that you won't stand for discrimination against lgbt people. htt‚Ä¶ purple smart's love for bureaucracy is infectious. i'd carry my own bottle of ketchup with me and pour ketchup on my dogs in front of all of wrigley field. i can't wait for archie vs predator; and i still think veronica got a secret boob job for that mini-series, just judging from the cover. of course! superion, not fort max. aww bummer. it just happens that my ""meh"" on the other characters outweighs my love for kamala. =/ not to be a party pooper, but i have no interest in the all new all gimmicky avengers, even tho i love kamala. odds on ""this is about ethics in ensemble casting"" reference by the writer? -- neigh 2 u! problem is, i do love my   soul, but because i do tons of short trips due to my work, i get way less than the revised mpg =/ pondering trading my   soul for a toyota prius. rt if you want to read more from that author, i'd recommend pluto has anyone disassembled rts cyclonus and paint his ears to match the comic? master keaton is fantastic! it's a good anime =o also, fuck any hayato sakamoto haters! #mtmte39 the #mtmte39 preview in a nutshell at least morrison is able to write an ending rt i'm not afraid for the extinction of our horrific species, i champion it at this point. we deserve no less. have you seen this bird? so basically volume 9 is gonna be, issue 48, 49 and a jumbo sized #50, am i right? i'll lick romney's toes for $75k. he might have a car elevator, but he doesn't have a personal toe licker. if we get pitchforks, could we start with you for defending the rich? #cnnbelike a perfect example of #cnnbelike mr. bunn. is the sixth gun really gonna end at #50? how is that gonna work for the trade? wytches comes out today? time to take migraine pills so i can read it. coloring gives me a headache... fucking called the reveal of lincoln march in batman eternal. q: i thought the matrix had been broken and split in two (and one half destroyed), did it regenerate? when are you gonna post your eccc ad/info? rt if i were ever abducted by aliens, the first thing i‚Äôd ask is whether they came from a planet where people also deny science. rodimus? i'd like to get rts rodimus. as for magnus and megatron, i'd like their cw versions, if they ever show up here. i need to slow down on my purchases =/ skids pretty much completes my mtmte for now. i mean, still pending magnus, megs and rodimus. i got it for cheaper than other skids i've seen on ebay applied i won a generation skids! with reprolabels included to boot how many issues total is sixth gun supposed to be? how many trades? i know the feeling ok, stop spending more money! stop spending money! all new all different avengers = tumblr's wet dream. with comic/movie posters, including some classic americana. that said, built-in shelves would do wonders for my toys, comics and manga - since i wanna change my 2nd living room into a geek nook. why did i get an idea of doing built-in shelves in my 2nd living room? i can't get it out of my head now. &gt;=( urm... 1950s... but who's counting. the point's the same or better. ;)‚Äù -- indeed! you can go even further back to the days of tezuka and make an argument for ribbon no kishi, and that was in the 60s those are fairly recent. but you got classics like rally vincent from gunsmith cats, the cast of bubblegum crisis, et al. maka albarn from soul eater, mikasa from attack on titan, michelle davis from terra formars, there's all this talk about strong female characters... and you realize that manga has been doing it for years. ugh, sneezed really hard and tweaked my back. need painkillers x__x indeed, bes ponee, relly gud art! -- while i'm ok with the batgirl cover being pulled -- this, in broad strokes, does apply to the controversy it's basically a rehash of kraven's last hunt. it even features a spider-man villain as the main bad guy. and i think guardian devil is possibly the worst daredevil story ever. its a huge disservice to karen page and black widow plus (c) i don't consider ""born again"" to be the best daredevil story. that distinction i give it to ""angels unaware"". rt ted cruz won't be coming for your guns. just your health ins, educations, reproductive rights, lgbt rights, &amp; your scie‚Ä¶ exactly how i feel. rt mtmte 39 delayed until april 8 (according to comixology's ""expected"" date). weh.  ted cruz, the proof the gop birther movement was all about race. #tedcruzcampaignslogans ew! any chance of getting a new one? w00t! got a complete rts cyclonus! i guess i wont get the cw cyclonus now. =p yeah lyn and tegan are such cuties. =o love yer stuff on fa =o =( really sorry to hear that =( i am reading atomic robo it may sound silly, but even tho i mainly sketch cheesecake, i don't like cheesecake comics. is there another comic crash just looming in the horizon? #fanquisition comics have increased in price faster than inflation has. 4.99 comics are around the corner. (c) i thought it was a zenescope book at first. =p spidergwen looks awesome in your style! yeah, eyeing an rts cyclonus as well, but i like the white ears on the chug one. goddammit! cats outside wont let me sleep with all their fights. should i get a classics rts cyclonus or wait for the cw cyclonus one? rt which opens up a can of worms about how we treat people with mental illness if we wanted to take it there‚Ä¶ rt i don't wanna cause anything but... üòÇ woah! =( wait wait, what happened? i've been losing a bunch of auctions on tf toys =( all because ebay forgot to notify me the auction was ending! &gt;.&lt; lost a good chance at a chug cyclonus for dirt cheap &gt;=( rt new curtailed! gadsden we never got those where i live =/ do you think the chromed parts would look better all solid black or leave as red, just dechromed? i see. it would be my first time doing any kind of painting so not sure where to start. do you ever use spray paint or just brush? in a bidding war goddammit! i lost another skids! =( i was gonna dechrome them after i saw the tutorial, but wondering if i should use brush or just spray primer and call it a day i was thinking of using spray on black primer, is that a bad idea even if i dechrome them? hey tf customs guys, if i wanna paint jetfire's guns, do i have to dechrome them first? oh yeah! i like it a lot. i tend not to like strike witches, kinda creepy, but i like that dirndl the irony in the dirndl being less ero than the other outfits. xd #redbullracing needs to shut up. they clearly weren't complaining when they were cheating with the kers during vettel's 2 championships so i aint even gonna bother, and the borderline books, they're in the chopping block. but yeah, thor #5 started me thinking there's comics that clearly dont want me in their demographic, which is fine! never really liked gillen's stuff. his stuff is basically tumblr pandering. like i said, i dont need a comic that hits me over the head just because i happened to be born white and with a penis. did you read thor #5? that was as hamfisted as it could possibly be. but on these days of concern trolls/pc police, you have to be careful on how you word things... thing is, i'm considering dropping that and other female-centric comics, because they just dont tickle me as much as others. not because its a bad book. it's a great book actually, but ultimately not my cup of tea. or rafa albuquerque in this case, because of the variant. thinking of dropping it. =/ if concern trolls want to see barbara sexually assaulted by the joker, it speaks more of their own misogyny than it does with alan moore. curious. if alan moore himself said there was no sexual assault in the killing joke, why are others saying otherwise? are you still reading lumberjanes? rt the hardest working publishers of comics in america! i have yet to see a megatron toy in our town! &gt;.&lt; rt our site has been officially updated! check it out right here: being able to see his mouth is kinda creepy +_+ rt last preview of my massskssss. i'll only have one mangle and you can see through the eyepatch on foxy. good to hear. given that a) he is prolly not gonna do the interview with you b) he blocked me for unknown reasons i aint buying that anymore but was hoping to buy it again if moreci could convince me. it was better than drifter, but i already read too many comics. it made sense to stop at the end of the first arc. wait. i did say i was dropping roche limit and drifter. but was hoping the interview would convince me to buy it again. never. in fact, i had been speaking highly of burning fields. i guess, but i never expected to be blocked by someone i've never interacted with. i dunno, i have not even talked to him at all! hmm... moreci actually blocked me. =o oh noes! =( really sorry to hear that =( seriously, i felt the newest thor is trying to make me feel guilty for having a penis. thor god of thunder = fantastic. new thor = tumblr pandering. i guess you havent been keeping up with thor? or because i think millennials tend to be entitled and i'm a boostrappy overachiever. you know, i don't buy comics so i can be hit over the head with a hammer about how terrible i am because i was born white and with a penis.

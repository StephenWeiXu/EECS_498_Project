""you mean the chaos emeralds?"" if you sandwiched a manuscript in there right now, the barnes &amp; noble staff probably wouldn't notice for at least a week. i'm the type of person who wishes you could cook quantifiable data into a lemon meringue pie and callously smear it in people's faces. rt ted cruz goes full orwell. i'd watch it. you know what the dc and marvel cinematic universes need? a mr. mxyzptlk and howard the duck crossover. yeah. i do a healthy amount of both, and i want to roast them over a tire fire. let's get it done, brohaim. i think i'll draw big mike next. i like having drawn much more than drawing, let me tell you. slippin' jimmy mcgill. alright. i'm almost done with this illustration, so pretty shortly i can be done being angry at it. pro tip: sometimes it's helpful to lie on the ground in an existential malaise, say ""fuck it,"" then get back to what you were doing before. *drops mic* i would love it if this were an ad for gillette. no, but it gets sung to me more often than i intended. why are the rumored names for both parties such duds? my gaming handle is ""fancy, schmancy!"", so whenever i hear the phrase irl, i brace for someone to say lascivious things about my mother. taking away the oxford comma was like taking kramer out of seinfeld. happy st. patrick's day. american history xmas. #makeamoviechildfriendly my microwave clock doesn't indicate am or pm, but the least you can ask from life is to not be in a situation where you didn't already know.

""let's admit that as a society we got tricked for about century into coveting sparkling pieces of carbon..."" rt some faces are faces some faces are masks and finding the false is the first of your tasks pro tip: be a good person. the market for bad people is too saturated. a car needs both gasoline and coolant, you know? also, don't drink gasoline or coolant. aaand now i'm a teetotaler. he's got to be working cheap at this point. i'd give him a free meal, but don't let him near the open bar. frank needs claire. i think i'll do her portrait tonight. rt if i were a lizard, i would certainly and frequently eat my own tail. i am a bear. i may technically be a millennial, but i'm old enough to know what grunge saved us from. and lo, cobain descended from heaven in robes of iridescent flannel, beholding the resurgence of 80's chic and crying, ""this shit again?"" this is all a winning formula. the week preceding a vacation is what makes the vacation necessary. daily drawing turned into more of a full-blown ink #illustration. frank underwood from i needed that. i've always needed that. rt my friend on the reality behind inhofe’s embarrassing snowball stunt. going to serially eat these soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies until i find the answers. you remembered what's important. i literally craned my head backwards and sighed in relief when i read the thermometer today. ah!! evan, these are great! 42°f. time to break out the air conditioning. meh. psh. it's iron man 3 that i skipped, i'm not a troglodyte. i like to let pop culture marinate for the better half of a decade before i consume it. i've never watched parks &amp; rec until now. i think i might be the male leslie knope. i'll see you in several dozen episodes. it's odin. you keep missing his calls. current status. priorities. are yolandi and ninja now the jay and silent bob of the blomkamp universe? my drawing feels really stifled and clumsy lately. i feel like this month needs to be spent in the dojo. oop! i'd be remiss if i didn't mention demeters is closed on monday's now. no more half-priced wines for now. lo siento. i got back on facebook for work after four years of being off. people welcomed me back like i'd gone off the grid. skepticism is like an oxygen mask. apply it to yourself before you assist others. ...god damn it. :-d well, shit, that's a lot of pressure. although the big crunch seems to be taking that shape, i think. suffice it to say, i know a lot of people in their late 20's and early 30's who feel this way. i have a long essay outlined in my head about this very subject. it's probably prime time to sit down and actually write it. born outside the matrix, but we can read every line of code. it's a weird generation to be a part of. as an older millennial, i find myself explaining younger millennials to gen x/baby boomers a lot. i wish i didn't have to. ""gentlemen, i think you'll find this powerpoint that i went totes ham on quite enlightening..."" help me out, guys: swipe right or left? your epistemology is fractured. #offendeveryonein4words craft is the new talk show. watching on i'd tap that. my heater has trouble kicking on when it's cold, which is like a firefighter not fighting fires because they make him sweat. say no to drugs. bonfire. first time i've been outside this long in a couple of months. i want to kneel in the ground like shawshank redemption. why did that never occur to me? damn it, i miss that place. the repertoire falls mostly into this category, ergo it is the best category. i'm sad that ""shway"" never caught on. art streaming at 9:30pm est tonight. i will be wearing a french collar. you're welcome? reading through tweets is lovely and makes me wish i had been reading them all along. what a beautiful spirit he had. it's my favorite cure that i like to pretend works. today, all social media managers are being asked to leverage this ""dress thing."" my advice: throw hot coffee at your superiors and run. do it. it'll keep me from getting frostbite. i saw blue and gold, and it doesn't mean anything except that i'm probably a casual nihilist. let's move on, shall we? instead of swiping right or left, you press and hold until the blood vessels in your fingers burst. bro, just walk away. i think it has the flu and this is what it's coughing up. false. the party always comes with the meatballs. it's science. fcc: ""isps shouldn't throttle the internet."" internet: ""haha! dresses! llamas!"" fcc: ""never mind. throttle it. throttle it now."" current status re: #llamawatch, #whiteandgold, et. al. i'll take your mother out to dinner. i take back everything i ever thought about uggs. these things are made of butter and orgasms. did you know uggs makes shoes for men? did you know they're the most comfortable things in the world? did you know you can go f*!k yourself? ...yeah, that would be nice to see. ... paralyzingly logical and perpetually angry, maybe. i don't understand the regulations well enough to know. but naive is the last word i'd use to describe tech people. ... the tech perspective on the issue is very entish. not fans of telecom companies, not fans of regulators. side? they're on no one's side. i'm on the periphery of tech, so it's hard for me to form a fully educated opinion. but those at the core seem pretty gleeful. feel what you will about the fcc ruling, but it goes to show what happens when you rouse the sleeping giant of the collective american nerd. oop! yep, l'll send it in the next few minutes. alright. i'm going back to work. weirdos. breaking: security footage preceding #llamawatch leaked. i hope there's a blip on the dow jones tomorrow because everyone left their jobs to watch some fucking llamas. llama chase? what llama chase? i shouldn't have to own a television to know shit like this is happening, where is it?! googlified it. daniel clowes, eh? i'll have to investigate. although i desperately wanted to draw a detective noir poster. is this an actual thing? i want to draw it real bad now. seems to have made a pretty radical shift in position, too. haven't seen tech blogs talk about it much. yep. no conflict of interest to see here. move along. between telecom lobbyists and unseen regulators, it's a real shit sandwich, this one. redesigning frelzo for and probably eating ice cream. let's get dirty.: rt i think it's a pretty safe to assume all joaquin's are annoying. rt a prominent climate change sceptic had undeclared funding from fossil-fuel companies rt we didn't start the fire. but we did give it some gas. character design: d'schaig. rt if you can make it in this city, you can make it anywhere in the galaxy. character design: querek. suh-weet. i'll try to get up on saturday. awesome. time for a jetpack field trip. btw, the new blog is awesome. never knew the premise until now, and now i absolutely have to read it. sometimes i join facebook political debates just to make nihilistic proclamations about the death of the universe. you know, for context. art streaming, yo. we are! remember before you critique someone's grammar or spelling that autocorrect is trying to sabotage us all. #skynet if she's going to be a wraith or something, it's a role she's been preparing for her whole career. ha! photo: character design: querek. have you ever wanted to know what's going on inside my head 24 hours a day? it's this. i think i'll read two opposing articles, blend their claims into a single opinion and pretend that's an objective way to discover truth. that's more or less how i summarized our opinion to an out-of-stater. nh, please tell me what i'm supposed to think about keystone xl. i'd research it, but that seems gauche. blend 'em into a purée or else you're a dweeb. you found my amazon review of the bible, i see. video: ""light cycles part 2"" by mogi grumbles. added to playlist. ugh, this topic is fascinating to me! stop it, i have to get back to work! :-d i do, too. the only opinion i hold personally is that investments like keystone are a band-aid. the u.s. needs to innovate quickly. true, although the possibility of spills are probably why granite staters are so vehement about preventing keystone. ... ... oddly enough, it seems to be regardless of party lines, but nhers are rather cynical about party affiliations, anyway. just my assessment, but it's a combo of environmental/safety concerns alongside a ""not in my backyard"" mentality. ... best. gif. ever. btw, that's not me arguing in favor of obama's reasoning, just that keystone gets nhers pretty riled. i can tell you that most of us in nh have a single-digit reason, and it's between our pointer and ring fingers. as a southpaw, i find the implications of ""swiping left"" a little prejudiced. been very satisfied with portsmouth  , with the admitted bias of having a couple of friends who work there. :-) if the trade-off for a great second act is a shitty poster, i'll take it. good. this is good. fuck cats. i can get behind this. ugh! can you believe all those things? it's like, welcome to the 21st century already. will this ""other stuff"" you speak of distract me from my own shortcomings? if so, i'm in. quirks, character defects. tomato, tomato.

"that hashtag has redeemed everything! you could have burned me so badly then. thanks for the mercy! flatshares are hard. people don't realise sometimes... no i totally feel your pain i just couldn't stop the dwarves reference from happening. how many in the flat? he is clever. but very old. well i think we've established who grumpy is... i just want to clarify that i'm not actually as silly as i am cornish, i just wanted to see who would take the bait! my money is on either doc or dopey. probably doc cos his eyes are shot to shit. it really is. this is a tremendous find, lube. what about bale? when was the last time this guy got a gig then? both of my sisters and i, celebrating 3 years of really really hard work (or not) #tbt the appreciation of spoons is never a bad thing. just never. i enjoyed it on the radio so i'll have to check it. they adapted it for tv?! balls, how did i miss that?! goooood spot. we're having a lovely time. rt first aid ✔️ first aid course lads. me and will be saving lives before you know it! #safe i really just want to keep doing ""paul scholes looks like..."" tweets but seems to be running away with this one. paul scholes in a suit looks like a p.e. teacher trying to look smart on parents evening. this new spotify desktop update really is the worst. it's a genuine struggle to use it now. 1 star. we'd laugh them out of town, us cornish! worst pasties ever. never gonna happen. they can barely hold the ball! this is honestly the most horrendous rugby match i've ever seen. catching is not that hard. #itafra congrats! it's been 7 years since my last headed goal so now i'm jealous. i would retweet every single one of your tweets if your account wasn't protected. gold dust. jess is dicking on life. what i'm learning today is that some of my friends' mums are really fit. horrible. feel for you pal! bollocks i've got danny ings as first goalscorer. anybody watching? looking likely? if they made an adult size one i'd probably have stayed there my whole life. not far off lukey! it was wonderfully cornish! #thingsfasterthanthemclarenhonda and yes...that is me. i think my   fiesta is quicker than that mclaren-honda. what an absolute dog. the needy one will definitely react badly to this. wow. just finished watching john wick. what an incredible film! hey anna! great to meet you too, i'm looking forward to the globals! so i'm in london. nice innit? i'm currently on my way to sexy london. keep it sexy 'til i arrive please, jon. i just love the way he tells the audience to shut up. have you been watching the 'theatre' one? i never thought i'd hear you say that. i think he's playing in the cricket world cup hahaha ok bye. oh god. they had such a great logo. rt i don't remember gerrard having such a long arm this is why fans are brilliant (warning: niche reference). i'm really fine with this. why is favouriting loads of my tweets? who is alena shishkova? a graze box, but with things people actually like. dodgeball is hard. he's great. just warming up for a dodgeball tournament. one of these days i'll just have a nice relaxing weekend...nonsense. it's the best. i just want to go to sharky's and play pool forever. fair to say i have had a laugh today. i love the last three words. ""this is brilliant."" rt this is what world book day is all about #revolution rt a roman walks into a bar, holds up 2 fingers and says, ""five beers please!"" champagne football at it's best, it's just like watching me and you. rt ""shes quite big for a bitch"" ""yeh but you can get feminine dogs and masculine bitches"" #cruftsoverheard #dogfeminists sorry, we didn't quite get that, she was meant to mention ready brek. why didn't she mention ready brek?! 74% of kids are fat now, would you like to speak to tv doctor lisa popodopoloctopus about it? would you? france circa '96. nana looking on top form in this one, interesting fashion choices from everyone… ahh i love the unplugged stuff! it's been too long since i last saw you guys, will have to address that. wow. that is horrific. it's so hard supporting this absolute shower at the moment. #nufc love getting snapchats from my more socially anxious friends, they look like they really don't want to be in their own photos. this is one of my favourite phrases of all time. i tried to watch it and it showed me an advert for jungle, that's got to be cheating. rt inside a violin rt ""i regret nothing. the end"" whatever the course is, it sounds great. glad to hear everything is normal with you xx i'm really worried that the new album from tallest man on earth might be a little over produced and echo-y. hopefully not. good luck wrighty, you don't have to play the full 90 do you? #onemorehalf the 6 music stage has absolutely nailed it. and laura marling. about time. sad news about dave mackay, one of cloughie's favourites. he could hit them when he fancied it! i had a right giggle at that! glad i wasn't the only one. i was trying to work out which you would dislike more! i think a bournemouth university challenge team would have been outstanding finished on 4. poooo. well they are up against ox ! very hard tonight! my pb came when they did a round on formula 1. heady days. i'm on two now...creeping up. they definitely are. i am struggling. well done though brainbox, 4 is to be respected! it's making me sad tonight. this is actually far too difficult tonight. i'm on 1 so far. #universitychallenge quinn's faces are doing my nut. #universitychallenge come on cambridge! i've liked this lot all the way through because they actually look like normal students. #universitychallenge yeah. thought so. i think i know what you're referring to... nothing makes me sadder than leaving bournemouth.  because we know how to watch rugby. amazing soundtrack though. probably not going to win the ballon d'or after this morning's performance. #stackedit #oops got a feeling that this evening could descend into nonsense. bournemouth with our lot usually inspires a good performance from all involved! if i was a doctor, this would be my diagnosis every time. no you're bang on. but i did know he had a lot of names. you underestimate me, fell. madonna will have as many bruises as her son david banda mwale ciccone ritchie has names. is madonna at the age where that's referred to as 'having a fall' yet? loved it! real life tinder was absolutely excellent. don't worry, always remember rule one. if all else fails, have an excellent surname. jeff's neck could be on the line after this latest balls up. #pray4jeff i hope nobody fixes this and they just keep going forever. wow rt do you think you could be the face of heart? we're looking for new fun, fabulous heart angels &gt;&gt; #glo… yes new death cab. obviously i have great taste in people! (i'm worried about your taste in films now though) i can confirm that this is a truly terrible film. never watch it! bless you, young child. amazing. stop looking so young. i love the comment underneath. ""those girl-only things like littering the bedroom floor with hair ties or spending hours gassing on the phone"" everything still hurts. #brightonhalf it's pretty much the only reason i exist. can't wait to see how ed miliband manages to do a worse interview than that natalie bennett one in this election campaign. rt reckon natalie bennett is like gareth gates was in 2002. give her an acoustic guitar and let her sing her policies and she'd… how have i only just realised that levels by avicii is a total rip off of polly by nirvana. i've let myself down here. rt fun kids radio’s nominated for nickelodeon kids' choice award just dealing with the big issues so you don't have to. i'd rather eat an electrical item. don't waste your time guys, orange and lime are still the best. these have taken pride of place in my 'worst sweets of all time' list. just tried those new apple tic tacs. absolutely rank. sorry, couldn't help it. i hate when people don't put a comma before someone's name when addressing them, harry. ok mate... maybe tell some of the other lads to have a go at tackling someone and he might not have to keep getting booked! i've said it before and i'll say it again, are sounding great! cue the most amazing music ever used in a film, ever. but a valid point. 3 and a half hours there. 3 and a half hours back. £26. megabus though. this is your fate glen, a life of shouting at cornish men. is it because your name sounds like a scottish town? why you always so angry at me, glenscott? did birdman win the oscar for shittest ending? well. amazing. cheers boy! i could start watching lord of the rings, then pop out and do a half marathon and still catch the ending. just got my official time through from yesterday's half marathon - 02:02:08. very very happy with that! the monster was unleashed today! going to bed with a smile on my face tonight. thanks everyone involved in any way with getting me into/through what i did today! i'm currently watching the hollyoaks omnibus and neither does that. as soon as it gets to ""not too early to order a chinese"", i'm going to order a chinese. rt we're today with our team of amazing runners - good luck team global's make some noise! as soon as my legs work again i will! cheers pet x nailed it. cheers mate! (i'll be sponsoring you soon) we've laid down the gauntlet here, step up big man. it's your time! just today. then i go back to being michelle. cheers kelly, (i'm beyonce today). where are you guys when i need you?! i've now joined the club. you know who's turn it is now don't you... if you'd have told me five years ago i would one day run a half marathon i'd have laughed you out the room. or 5 months ago actually... immense feeling of pride, running the brighton half marathon today. then i had a beer. excellent stuff all round! rt jonny from finishes the for #teamglobalsmakesomenoise brighton half marathon. none of my jeans fit me any more but other than that, it's been an incredible… ahh lovely auntie roush. oh yeah, you can sponsor me! oops. i really am bad at fundraising. my legs are doing the half marathon, not my family. should have made that clearer. as a child my family named me maggot legs because of how skinny my little legs were. tomorrow they're doing a half marathon. never give up. early night - in less than 12 hours i'm running the half-marathon that has been responsible for none of my jeans fitting me anymore. i can't even have a drink while watching this horror show because i'm running a half marathon tomorrow morning. thanks world. #nufc i've watched since the start and that is god punishing me. haha now you're just being stupid. we won't get 1. just do it. if i had anything better to do, now would be the time to do it. being a newcastle fan with john carver as our manager is like watching someone you love get repeatedly smacked in the teeth. #nufc i've got genuinely no interest in watching newcastle get spanked by man city. absolutely none. we can't even compete. #nufc have you just found out i'm not coming back to bournemouth or something? rt it's great how the eggheads have now been given gladiator-style names. we all heard the music box carry on after ian had shut it there, right? this is like an a-level drama exam. #eelive not even when rapping along to the fresh prince of bel air? i realise my mistake. i thought you were just being urban. i don't know, kerry katona's is interesting. one of my mates is known exclusively as iron lung after he once answered a pub quiz question over enthusiastically. as long as you think tenenbaums is the best one it's all fine. but the life aquatic soundtrack is nice. so not totally bad. p.s. i love my name. and i always shorten my friend's names or give them creative ones - boys school mentality init wrong way round m9. so true, j. this is amazing. is this what happens at your work? job going isn't there... #tweetsfrom1952 the noise i make sounds a lot like your name, actually. rt final 50 tickets for this, tonight: the last of 92 performances of flaws. book! they won't be left by show time. i've never been to a ballet before but i'd be happy to make an exception in this case. let's check flights. more than likely, though if i'm whinging that at least means i've written something which would be excellent! ahh yeah i suffer from that one. listening makes me envious of the people that can write amazing stuff. does it go something like ""why didn't they use my sketch, that was the best thing i've written. fudge."" i never thought i was but stuff like that - when the characters come through the doors, just gets me! for you dear. that is amazing. rt for lent this year i'm just giving up all together so much better than the real thing, it actually smells like bacon frazzles. but always nice to know you're getting my emails. i hate being rumbled by my colleagues! oh god. i've done it haven't i?! i hate students. said it before and i'll say it again, student union presidents don't make good presenters. why the overload of videos (and boring content)?! they just care so much. fair play to bournemouth uni, still emailing me to make sure i haven't got chlamydia. cheers guys.

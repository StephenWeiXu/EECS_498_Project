"for someone they fired is playing a lot of with in it. #justsayin #notcomplaining #bringbackclarkson this right here is why #daleearnhardtjr will never win a championship. he doesn't care, he's got more‚Ä¶ lord am i tired, i want my bed. better do this little bit of work so i can find a nice corner to take a nap in. #life ya know it might be asking a little too much that i can find happiness. i'll always be on the verge but i'm not destined for it. #life one thing i've learned, there are a lot of cool girls outside of #memphis #tennessee area. problem is, in in fucking memphis tn. #fml #life rt the weekend: expectation vs reality this is how i feel everyday when i open my eyes. the pain never stops and remains like spears‚Ä¶ the older i get the more my eyes open and the less things i'm blinded by. knowing the #sheep like mindset of #people things make more sense. rt important things to remember as you grow older: rt gutted at such a sad end to an era. we're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it's been an incredible ride‚Ä¶ rt my favorite moment #onthatbombshell #topgear rt the longest farewell... . . . . . . . . . ...in the world. #onthatbombshell #ciaojeremy photo: it has been fun, at least i got to talk cars in this sad car day. i got to get to work to check it again, i said ancient design with a huge motor. the suspension design is ancient. i'm not slandering when i say it can't go around corners, it's been proven. you said they were unreliable and i said they were good to drive, we both have never owned one, were basing of reputations yes a hell car is for drag strips and a   is for sustained autobahn speeds of over 150 mph no i haven't, but you said they had a unreliable reputation and i responded with another reputation they are said to have you'll grow out of that one day, trust me. i bet above 100 it shakes like it's falling apart. you made a remark about a car you never owned, how do you know alfas are unreliable? i use to like american cars too, then i looked outside and liked that better. i love my   and mini to death i have driven both american and european, and the build of the euros far exceeds the american cars. well lucky i have a mini cooper and i can say it runs and handles great. i'm just going by reputation as you suggested. i have never driven one so i don't know if there good or unreliable. just curious, why ask me? like the cars you like holding onto the past. germany has moved on from that. were you not asking clarkson what he thought of the gt that led us to this? no actually i prefer germany more. uh have you never watched top gear. all three agree on that. that's the reputation im going by. and apparently fools. in demand of a bunch of straight line braggarts. unreliable, but excellent to drive when they are running. your right it can, but not at a fast speed, it will understeer right off the road/track watch the episode of top gear with it, it did it pretty well. but was only .3 of a second faster than an alfa 4c who wants to go in straight lines anyway, that's not fun at all no the vette can go around corners pretty good last i checked. yeah, and ancient car design with a huge motor in it. as clarkson said of the challenger, it's a point and squirt muscle car. now what's he in? a volkswagen. what won the wrc title the last 2 years, a fiesta, no a volkswagen. but it's the european car makers that are discovering the new technology. the viper no, the vette yes(racing background) the focus yes(european bred) and the fiesta no(its not ken blocks rally car) let them and prove me wrong. but don't hype up a car as groundbreaking that was built from tech that was not earned. that's why they can't go round corners lol ? oh yeah that's why the powerstroke ford is so good. i've lost count of how many of them i've worked on. it's not the ignorant that is speeding, it's the ones talking on the phone, riding in the left lane, and texting. let's look at that as a european. what will i buy, a lambo,  , ferrari, mclaren? no i think i'll get a ford. it's a running gag that is disrespectful, people from other countries dont shorten/misspell the name of their country as a gag i'm just saying it will be built to a certain price. my   and mini are both built better than american cars of their age american exotic makes no sense, for something to be exotic it has to be foreign to a place. well this government takes a good bit of my pay and the police try to steal the rest by hiding in the dark catching speeders i can take jokes, but shorting the name of a country that so many have fought for is not a joke, i see it as disrespectful. and it was a mercedes, there were no rules back then so you could drive anything on the road. i would like to move to europe. and i'm ignorant? quit being ignorant and lazy, it's america not murica, that shows ignorance not all, i respect the corvette, they earn their knowledge through sports car racing. but all others are trash built to a price it's not an f1 car, but it uses f1 technology that ford knows nothing about cause they failed at that in 2003. first road legal car was a mercedes. but for everything else, the rest of the world has moved on and improved those things. they don't know how those air channels will work because they have no real racing experience in the last 20 years. the design of this car is like putting a big spoiler on a fwd car, everybody else is doing it lets do it. yes but american cars are always the last to get to the revolutions, then they try to make it cheaper to sell it. rt well case is always watching about time he shows he actually wants it, where was that last year. well yeah, i would. cars designed on a piece of paper mean nothing when it's on a track. no experience = crap car it is in no way groundbreaking. it's taking what others have done before and copying it. it lacks any motorsport foundation interior design means nothing if it's filled with cheap plastic it's stolen design, ford is only involved in the wrc and nascar, neither of which brings technology for supercar production. power to weight means nothing if it understeers off the track. straight line heroes do not make a supercar. yes its not the same car it will be made of cheaper materials that will fall apart. may have 600hp but it wont go round corners rt aggies still be like: ""we'll flip jefferson. just watch!"" i have seen the new ford gt, it's a cheap rip off of a laferrari and lambo asterion. just like for copying everyone else thank you you showed me that there are better #cars in the world than the cheapüí©that #america produces. your not done yet! second day of #spring temperatures and i'm already #miserable. i honestly hate the heat almost more than anything! it's a kinda day. me when i found out #jeremyclarkson was getting fired. #fthebbc #topgear jeremyclarkson honestly if i could get in #bed and never get out of it, i would in a heartbeat. i'm not #lazy i'm just tired of dealing with the #world cool these #spawns of #satan are back. i just love #spring time when you start to sweat again, things‚Ä¶ without new with i think i will just crawl in a hole, won't be nothing but #shit on tv from now on! well this #shit day continues. with gone is done. like chris evans could replace him, just kill the show #americas #police ain't nothing but damn crooks anymore, driving around in unmarked #cars catching us ""dangerous"" #speeders. #fuckthepopo rt today: - brekkie - pretend to be bffs w france - pretend to be bffs w spain - be totes crafty - have moment of doubt - dis‚Ä¶ yeah i'm pretty fucked up, prolly ain't gonna change anytime soon. #smh #life rt mind = blown ok some serious negativity coming now, was trying to avoid it but i got to get it out. #memphis‚Ä¶ ok so updated 2015 travel plan. going to #germany as planned to drive round the #nurburgring. after‚Ä¶ i just want a girl to watch with.üòî #spartacus rt gilligan‚Äôs island: gilligan‚Äôs first name was willy. rt today: - brekkie - stride about palace full of confidence - sit on horse gazing into distance until it's noticed how kingl‚Ä¶ words cannot describe how i hate those little #welder caps, especially on ppl that dont #weld. u think u look cool, no u look like a cunt i can sort out f1 let use the old v8, close to the same hp so they will quit their whining! #f1 found this pic from a few years ago. prolly one of the best pics of my car i've seen. #dirttrackracin‚Ä¶ #saxa and #mira today when i got home and just after their fight, seems they get along like the‚Ä¶ it's 1:20 in the morning and i'm not even halfway done! 16hr #work day #fuckinhell misunderstood the coordinators today now i'm stuck at this place for 16hrs, well 14 and a half now. #work i don't see how racing for is a good thing. driving a car that the team doesn't want you in, not good for either rt you bastard. #bah rt save clarkson?

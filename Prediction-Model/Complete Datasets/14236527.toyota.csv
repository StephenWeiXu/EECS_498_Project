how do you explain need to client? would be interesting (educational?) to see a full-blown json parser written in assembly. :d agreed. not convincing me either. hence my tweet asking for any counter points on performance from real-world use. i think you are probably right about that. have you come across any json parsing libs that are ""swifter""? it could be that json parsing is the slow piece, but it is ""lightning quick"" according to their github page. ;-) true, the objc-like swift impl didn't have -o due to segfaults; the swift version did use -o and much slower. rubymine faster too true, but the performance using ""first party"" json parsing also did not fare well in his tests. can anyone offer a strong counter point to the findings in this article about swift performance?

"watching the babe ruth ep of the ken burns series baseball. so when does ruth cure a kid from polio just by saying ""hi kid!"" to him? wait so shredder falls in a dump truck &amp; is supposedly crushed. but no one thought to take his body out of it &amp; dumped him in a landfill? don't worry little guy here is a rita hayworth jpg you can make virtual tunnel behind watching 'life itself'. great doco about roger ebert. but, and i hate saying this the shots with the sick roger ebert are rather confronting the last ep of house of cards was like bad wrestling booking. frank had a great heel promo, but was deemed meaningless just minutes later. rt this is how sirga the lion greets her owner each time they meet the first series is on netflix. but it's in japanese with subtitles. i don't mind that. attack on titan is like if hbo made an anime. that's probably the best way i can describe it. i'm loving the attack on titan anime series. because well, it's an anime that's not really like a typical anime. if that makes sense. btw the teaser for the attack on titan movie looks incredible. (japanese) i can't watch the live action attack on titan movie. not until i have gotten through the animated series. don't know who is in the attack on titan film. but considering the setting of the show i would not mind if they we're european in look. there is a live action 'attack on titan' movie coming. the good news is that m night isn't making it. wonder if there was ever a body in bailey's boot on the big breakfast? fuck what redfoo thinks! oh the people i can send this to. rt a new service online allows you to send someone a bag of edible dicks in the post 2022 football world cup to be played in december. they should call it 'a very fifa christmas' well done .. now for the real thing. just guessing. but it's something that tub of pies would do. is the footy show back? huh let me guess.. billy brownless has done that kardashion break the internet picture. *shudders* prediction: if brendon bolton knocks back a head coach position at the end of the year.. al clarkson will retire at the end of 2016 #afl amazing that none of the teams looking for a new coach at the end of 2014 pushed hard for brendon bolton #nabchallenge live podcasts: just like the regular podcast but poorly recorded, the host shouts more than usual, and people shouting 'wooo!' at everything isaac smith scores all 7 in the 7 point play. like it #nabchallenge #gohawks and it was future hawk ben mcavoy that kicked the tie making goal for the saints. funny how things work out and how shitty was channel 7 for that game, no replays of the alleged interchange fuck up. fox footy are replaying the hawthorn/st kilda tied game from 2010. what fucking mess the umpires made of that game. wish i was like my female friends on facebook. they ask for help, get a dozen reply in seconds. i ask for help, will be lucky to get a reply rt hey bill shorten you should check out my metadata today, i'm spending a lot of time googling ""why does the alp have no sp… rt bob is shocked at his wife's audacity..

'get hard' has a ma15+ for strong nudity. don't get your hopes up and that it involves co-star alison brie. usually means a lot of dicks. rt somedays i feel living with #aspergers is totally incompatible with the world &amp; what's expected of me woolworths looks like they are taking a slice of the coles ""annoying as fuck"" commercial pie. come on aldi where is your fucking awful ad? those aerial shots of melbourne during the #f1 are alone worth the price of having to host the event. the world is seeing those shots. rt oh god, bbc please take him back... he's started cooking... i really don't like guinness. i tried time and time again to get used to the taste. but i can't. at least clarkson actually follows up on a threat to hit an asshole. award shows are almost aways bad, but the worst are the ones corporations run to congratulate themselves. foxtel have their own awards show. it's like their own version of the slammy awards. rt post-apocalyptic charlie brown and snoopy. #jeffwecan 😃 upon research i discovered jonathon banks was in two paul hogan movies.. flipper, and crocodile dundee in la. 😨 man where was jonathon banks in the 90's and early 2000's ? robin thicke.. coming soon to a run down carnival near you. rt don't blame us. rt they got a point. rt hey . do you need to have a lie down mate? i only ask because you're being a massive dumbcunt. #lifestylech… sorry. is it bin night? #ssetotalfootball what else do you do in a pool? stroke. as in deathstroke slade wilson .. hey, if i didn't know better, rt man dressed as a pirate threatens security guard with knife on the set of the #piratesofthecaribbean film god, i hope the hawks (afl) and the mclaren #f1 team won't be a source of disappointment this year. btw listen to that podcast i just rted when it's up. rt we will repost the tonight. rip rip sam simon gordon solie wrestling announcing legend seen here listen to ladies pee. #picoutofcontext dear ... i'm australian and does not speak for me. detroit, cincinnati and chicago ... oh my! rt #jeffwecan break the internet. for lenny the actual winners of the #nabchallenge are teams that can get through the games without getting major injuries to their players. can you change to the spanish team? just a reminder: bill murray was in 'wild things' looked it up. i was curious. guessing there is no bill murray in this one to make it better. don't knock it, they probably spent millions on market research coming up with that name. in house of card uk the equivalent event haunted the protagonist for the rest of the series. in the us version .. nothing really. something was lacking in #houseofcardsseason3 .. an event from season 2 was pretty much ignored, like it didn't happen. still pretty good. can't believe there are people that will hate watch a show.

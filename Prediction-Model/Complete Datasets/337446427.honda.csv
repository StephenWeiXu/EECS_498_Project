"how will coaches now when to play their walk-ons and scrubnees, though? i mean, they wait way too long now as it is. kentucky's scrubnees had one rebound, one foul and two turnovers, total. they need to run some laps. he's played just 51 minutes this year, total. in his career, he's played only 116 minutes total. once again, as an announcer, reggie miller is at the level of the rec league player that chucks up 20 shots a game and never calls a foul. you need to speak to nope. if the ball is trending down toward the basket it is a goal tend. period. not the rule at all. sorry you lost your bet, but the rule is clear and has been for years. madness! i tell you! madness. and yes, i had iowa state in the sweet 16, losing to gonzaga, so it's not so bad. four years ago i held her hand and i never let go. happy anniversary i think the equinox broke our dog... whatever boise state was doing there, it wasn't good. why doesn't or ian eagle go scoochie boochies! #jayandsilentbob stephen a. smith and dick vitale together in an ad? i never wanted to buy oberto products anyway, i guess... i only hate mine because i have to pick kentucky. i'd rather gargle glass bathed in bleach, but alas... so you say a default setting in configuration was changed? and you wonder why results have been wonky? well then... i guess if you want to work for the right wing, you can't criticize fox nor trash iowa and steve king. ah.... rt the old game show family feud, updated = clever idea, tough game not the hugest fan of byu, nor ole miss, for divergent reasons. but this is good hoopin'! hey , looks like incarnate word got a whopping 1,811 there tonight. they lost. zooked, but in basketball.... they couldn't. the 'first four out' got #1 seeds. damn shame, really. no one will play them, so they can't get a good sos. soon someone may come around to the larussa idea of 3 man rotations with 3 inning blocks for pitchers. rt washington governor declares drought in these three regions: #drought #washington #inslee rt sarah mclachlan asks, won’t you adopt cliff lee for just 53 cents a day? my revolution starts now... ask cotton if russians are at moscow's door... there are some good d3 teams already out of their tourney that may want another game. yes, to the same person i hit rediail twice and and sent a draft if didn't mean to. i'm about ready to crawl in a hole. ever realize that for all the technical stuff you know, you can fail at email and phone. #hitsend #hitredial rt ftw. hey hope this picture helps you out. i bet if fraidy-cat bcs schools would have scheduled them they'd have that win. same story every year for mids. wichita state's non-conference schedule strength, per kenpom is 66th. indiana's is an abysmal 317th. don't fall for the wsu has a weak schedule trap. bcs conference won't schedule them! corrupt practices shut 'em out! who did you miss? hey , portland is not a home game for arizona. way too far, and portlandians do not cotton to arizonans. i definitely will do two brackets this year. one with the forgone conclusion and one if anarchy happens. hey, i supported air force that year because it was a big up yours to major conference shills and mediots. i tried to get tix in spokane last year to watch michigan state and it was impossible, though. the zags fans will buy them all, though. no, that's presumptuous. msu has to win first (as does uva). 7-10 games are notorious. sfa is very plausible. isn't it presumptuous that msu gets to uva? butler will beat them. it's in pittsburgh. butler will travel there. they will lose to butler, though. i love that book! the spiders didn't need any help to be wretched, though! at the time, really hated showboating or all that. didn't like syracuse or oklahoma under tubbs. i've mellowed, i think... the players, though, is where i'm at. at the time, couldn't stand the rebels. this kentucky bunch doesn't seem so arrogant. rt this? awful rt have y'all seen the sunbelt tournament floor? it's horrendous how the hell can you tell if it's a 2 or a 3 on the near section of the sun belt tourney floor? help! i wonder what tv ted valentine thinks about reffing the sun belt tourney. as much as i hate kentucky (forreasons and unmitigated audacity in cheating and past racism), i can't loathe this team like i did unlv. send more chuck berry... as an iu fan, i'd rather see murray state in. i think it all depends on if uconn wins. touche. still irritated at him to this day. you know what could eliminate this? turn the tournament back to the real tournament.... i've seen worse. i'd rather watch that than a taxi cab parade with faux cautions and wwe endings. theodoric of york, medieval barber... signed up for hulu plus. watching the 1978 steve martin blues brothers snl. holy cow, that's funny! you sure that isn't a footwork or a simtek, and not a mclaren? this attrition in f1 reminds me of the 70's and 80's in usac / cart and f1 when it seemed the engines were wound to the very limit... reminds me of some 70's races in usac. the turbo offies were wound really tight. only 16 qualified in monaco in 1970. not in the 60's. a 17 car grid at zanvoort in in the early days they had some grids of 14 or lower. some of the 60's grids had 17 to 19 cars regularly. wow, even the lotus indy car made the first corner. nice job mclaren. i guess they don't want people to keep accurate stats for oregon tonight. #cantseethenumbers i agree. pitt and syracuse back to the big east and put in marquette, dayton and creighton. or dayton. one of those. they also fit the profile of most of those teams. add creighton to make it 10. when a team from a low major wears dark jerseys more than once during their conference tournament, and wins, then it's 15 or 16 seed time! i wonder if my 2000   accord is faster than the mclaren  s this year. by silly phobias i mean fear of failure, fear of what others think, fear of losing everything. buit those are self-fulfilling if i dwell. but more importantly i will succeed and soar, and will be a huge part of that. my goal is that i will heal myself and my relationships, and heal my work relationships and attitudes and help cwu succeed and soar. i will use the resources around me. i cannot live in frustration and anger any more. i must be positive, strong, loyal and loving. wednesday at 9 i start my journey. with this weekend i will have the best care. i will get through monday and tuesday. by taking care of myself, thinking before acting, taking sight of what others see and feel i will get through this.i will no longer be angry this has been a rough 10 days. may be the nadir of my life in some respects. but life is wonderful. i am good. i will succeed. i have not made self care a priority. with that comes care for those i love and respect. i'm going to get help. i know i am loved. i know i am good. i know i am human. i will get help. i will succeed but i must be patient with me it's not ok to take my frustrations about my silly phobias out on people. i need to take care of me. think before acting or reacting. i need better self care. i need to tell myself i'm ok and it's ok to make mistakes of effort at work. it's not ok to be frustrated... rt the last digit of pi is 6. now you know. #happypiday oh, cripes. gamer gate people throw that around to brand anyone who won't let them be misogynistic or racist. bob loblaw lobs endorsement bomb we have three graduations though. why would there be? maybe you'll also realize that this is treasonous action... rt tom cotton seems like the ultimate neocon: untainted by actual knowledge of the countries he would like to bomb. matt mackowiak, aiding and abetting treason... you're as wrong about this as you were about nate silver. seek out a theocracy somewhere else. i'm not feeling all warm and fuzzy: this isn't a treaty though, is what i heard... you are no christian . my church will pray for you to learn about love, grace and tolerance being gay isn't a choice but being a racist, sexist, anti-poor, islamophobic hate-bag is. the game itself was exciting, and i love it when bad teams upset good ones. comeuppance! rt republicans don’t know how to govern, but they do know juvenile political attacks. they're undermining our commander-in-ch… well, it is relative in size and scope. first championship was 1939, though in the early years the nit was actually the preferred tourney. they and northwestern should have a play-in game one day, as it were. though normally i loathe not inviting regular season champ to the ncaa tourney. don't be a spoil sport! this is great drama! did they have classes at wofford today? i think everyone at wofford is in asheville right now. i mean everyone. you'd have played with bullock again! also for football the travel could hurt budget. small state schools don't have a lot of cash. it is for travel, especially for the non revenue sports. ovc is quite compact. entire athletics program and budget needs to be factored in. wow. i am hearing vernon reid's great guitar riff from cult of personality right now... ovc is perfect for them for their institutional footprint and entire athletics department. realignment not needed. i've been an iu fan since 71. got my mba there. murray is better right now and would make it a better tourney. at x, not easy and in november which again suggests arrogance that teams cannot improve unless they are bcs. xavier is a lot better than those clowns. also, teams can't improve? murray playing better than i right now. how much softer of a soft-tosser can he be? so much for home site tournaments! and the nit slots are filling fast! so much for playing the tournament at home sites. seems chaos is reigning in those leagues... rt a children's treasury of espn commenters' sexist, racist remarks following women's basketball fight. victim complex? i'm ashamed at some of your responders. they need to check their privilege. btw, murray state's non-conf sos via ken pom? 244th. mainly because of fraidy cats who won't play them. non conference sos according to ken pom is 320th! 320th! horrible! they control that. murray can't really., home non-conference. sorry. but lamar, or unc greensboro or miss. valley state or uno or grand canyon? ick. i wouldn't expect more. fraidy cats. see the hacks and frauds on their home mom conference schedule? non conference schedule under crean riddled with patsies for home games. schedule up! can't say they need to schedule better and then not schedule them when they ask. grown? what? play murray state or other good teams instead if one of the guarantee patsies. otherwise it's corrupt scheduling. bcs schools are too fraidy cat chicken to schedule murray state. not the racers fault, it's the fat cats. i don't know if you have seen this. darnell hillman was my favorite pacer as a kid. #drdunk pan seared and broiled top sirloin (with sauted garlic and shallots) with broiled lobster tail and green beans! yeah, i did that.... they should be. the scheduling practices of the bcs schools are disgusting. murray st. can't get games. the bcs schools refuse to schedule a team like murray state. they can't get games to help their sos and rpi. sad. rt onions!!! and bcs schools are too fraidy-cat chicken to schedule murray state. a shame that murray st. may not make the tourney if they lose. they're quality and they'd make it bonkers! #ncaa i love college hoops b/c of the contrast. imagine murray st against uva. the tempo clashes would be interesting... rt do conservatives think dems try to hide that some ds were segregationists? is this a gotcha? they became republicans. after a rough week at work i appreciate more and more... rt so let me get us conservatism right: armour piercing ammunition is an inalienable right, but vaginas aren't. ok, got it. i got 463 points on friday news quiz! rt how does get away w racist comments in majority-minority district? ""he's a very powerful man"": lockbox... ""john told dennis willie guy was dead"" was a sentence i just typed. of course, there were over 3500 at the b10 women's first round featuring 14/11 and 12/13 games. #creativecounting i saw the attendance at the cwu women's game was 278. what numerical system did they use? i mean, its a tourney in billings without a host. hey i love baseball, but i don't know if split doubleheaders against a d3 school is a 'treasure'...hah! rt video comment: 25 years ago tonight hank gathers died. his story, and how i struggled to cover the nightmare on la tv h… you'd think a computer scientist would understand what a blog is, right? you really don't have a clue about what scotusblog is, do you sufferfest? duke is beating wake forest like they were notre dame or something... now it's time for the to shine in billings! great season by the even though it ended today. big time improvement and lots to be proud of by the three seniors. c'mon get some buckets! maybe they should talk about ufo (schencker era, of course...) for most of those years, no at large teams and tourney was strictly regional. old men yelling at a cloud... trigger cut / wounded kite at: 17 if only we'd all listen to , we'd be a lot better off! i think i'm going to subscribe to the alabama shakes newsletter... tough loss for but i think they'll surprise in the gnac tourney. men have a definite chance to claim the crown! heading to st. martin's soon with to watch claim a gnac playoff spot! narwhals! rt young republicans favor legal marijuana (63%) &amp; same-sex marriage (58%) you mad, bro? i feel if i do go to see saturday i'll need to bring laptop to do the stats while i watch! now, i debate whether and i make the 2 1/2 trek to support at st. martins saturday.great win tonight at wou! hey , nw nazarene women regressing to the mean. shooting less than 30% tonight #ofcourse forget it david, you're in rubintown. it's lose-lose against a shape-shifter... i think the llamas can shoot free throws better than michigan state, or minnesota. omg! michigan state escapes and luckily goes into ot! gus just went crazy on the b10 network! i think that's tom griffin as the model... i'm hoping that some alumni or student named rosencranz marries a guildenstern... mike gravel hey , so you didn't enjoy the hoosier teenage ritual of sliders at wc after a night out on the town? only way i could eat them campus sites. base in 'seeding'. if the cwu women lost to wou, and other things happen, there will be five teams at 6-11 and one at 5-12. only two teams will make tourney. i think the water carriers like and need to read this from rt perhaps o'reilly mistakes the certitude of his no spin zone for fact, but we don't have to. my npr column: rt tv star sean hannity doesn't think we should listen to celebrities talk about public policy. okay. so what do the billo water carriers and think of the footage released? still supporting a whiny loud crybaby liar? i forget, or try to forget, most best picture movies. the english patient anyone? who peed in your adult beverage tonight? rt patricia arquette had the temerity to call for income equality. she obviously hates america. is this the part where rwnjs think that hollywood's sending the country to hell? it was wonderful! tegan &amp; sara, questlove, devo, will arnett! better than stuffy blah blah boring ponderous crud. all of those people are tremendous! no need to be a curmudgeon! don't be a curmudgeon. the lego movie is great! and that's a great tune! nope. it was awesome! questlove, devo, will arnett, tegan &amp; sara. what's not to love? yeesh, you mad bro? you missed rob lowe and snow white... are you blocking nph then? :-p i eat hot tamales at work! as incorrect as your hypothesis on giuliani and your defense of jeb's web guru not being racist (or sexist as with jeb's guy...) about 20 to 25 years ago...longer maybe i'm semi-embarrassed i knew that without looking it up! hey, it wasn't harry gross,it was henry gross, and the song was ""shannon"",not ""chevy van"" (that was sammy johns) it's taken about 45 minutes to play the last 45 seconds of the osu / michigan game... i thought the player was great. and i'm no insider. panty hose in raising arizona "

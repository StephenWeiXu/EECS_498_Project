it's not close imo. where would you rank this uk team compared to 06-07 fl, 08 ku, 09 unc, and 12 uk? i agree. and maybe an ok, osu, nd, or unc team gets them at home too. unc i'd take at home most other years, but not this year. i don't think that's insane to say. i could see ku, isu, duke, or va knocking them off at home. rt i think drives that car. he's hopped on that bandwagon just like all the other ones that were hiding during the mcdermott era. probably. it's isu colors and he's drinking insane amounts of that cyclone cool-aid. i've come up with a name for those flame graphics...""ku tournament takes"" i pick them to win it every single year. one of these years, i'll be right again. #kumbb rt this i do know - bill self's program will be a national laughingstock if ku loses to wichita state after al‚Ä¶ bill self's program will be a national laughingstock if ku loses to wichita state after all of self's bluster."" lol rt a male and a female are acting ""very friendly"" with each other at 13th and prairie. the man is laying on top of her while kid‚Ä¶ oh. yeah, he might. you'll have to tell me who call. is. i can understand your frustration since bo ryan hasn't won either of those awards. maybe this is his year?

you can't disagree with that because it's a fact. all 68 teams in the field have a chance. now there's 2 teams with a 0% chance to win the title. ha, unfortunately not. as much as i want to see them lose in round 1, i'd also like to see an isu/ia sweet 16 matchup. who's your college basketball team? logically, any of the 68 teams could make the final 4. no team has a 0% chance. that's an unintelligent statement, every team has a chance to make the final 4. they've done it 22 times, but i see your point. they're such a good defensive team.

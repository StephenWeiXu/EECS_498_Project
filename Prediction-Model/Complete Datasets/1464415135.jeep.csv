#uconnect thank you for arranging our new #kiacarnival my wife loves it #happywife i wanted to give a big shout out to bek in your psm who did a fantastic job. we have been a corporate client now for 15yrs. i was hoping you could mention the runforestrun fun run and fair to your followers. 22nd march. tks you want to know how dumb some of the engineering is on the i8, check out this video my 930 is by far the best phone i have owned. denim has only made it better #cortana yep found on ozbargain and got the whole family and company to claim the space. alp = nfi and it shows. he has no idea what metadata is or how it will stop the nasty terrorists no need to show that footage of the greyhound blooding. way to graphic for 7pm, did not,hear a warning either #badtv how can i pay for cloud storage for my dropcam in australia? rejects any attempt and i need this feature problem is my 2nd phone is also a 930. hope i win the #lumia830 today so i can try it out i need #cortana to save my wife from killing me tomorrow. have not done anything and cant think of anything.#cortana&lt;3 great so my $600 930 will not run it, but my sons $79 630 will. great work. guess i will be waiting #lumiawp10 now you can grab a spraycan and tag the tracks you are at with your new stencil #tagthetrack how about some details on the models, specs and pricing ? sort of glad i missed out on ""winning"" the #techmyway ""competition"" cortana is my portable wife, able to answer any question and tell me what is happening...and always right #cortana&lt;3 i meant to say quali, i would rather have free access without practice than pay foxhell. ch10&amp;1 did practice and races free. foxtel causes the viewership to decline. v8sc will decline as well this year for the same reason. i have ""walk like an egyptian"" from the bangles, as it has a loud start so i can hear it. #ringtones hi kochie, any chance of a rt for a fun run fundraiser for my kids school?. if you think the vr is good, you should try a rift with elite dangerous. it is like really being in a spaceship. #oculusrift always look on the bright side of life #inspiremyway #techmyway can't see you getting under the cars in that onesie. sorry craig, i am watching the #b12hr wished you were driving #v8scfail agreed. i blame the way our voting with preferences. causes minority parties to wield control and prevent consistency #auspol bathurst 12 hr is far more interesting, pity you think you need to compete against them #b12hr thank you for streaming the qualifying, can't wait for the race tomorrow #b12hr please for the sake of the country and government stability, put your name forward. we need a good leader and you are it always look on the bright side of life #inspiremyway #techmyway time to get a windows phone. depending on which carrier you are with, you can pickup a 630 or 530 nokia smart phone for &lt;$100 you should have gotten a flip case, would have saved you a lot of money by now. just checked my 930 and denim is currently downloading. non carrier model of the 930 from harveynorman why have you made no announcement about the online investing platform being down all day ? when will it be backup? #failwestpac sydney australia. but i checked your website and none were listed. same with ebay and amazon. i want to buy a #fitbitsurge in x-large, but you have none listed on the website to purchase. when can i get this size ? if you pay the fine, you do not do the time. they are not innocent when will you be releasing details of the new #kiacarnival ? why are you linking pics of a usa spec car. why have you released no details on the au spec car yet ?#kiacarnival rt rt if you are a #windowsphone / fan you are a #cortanafanðŸ˜‰#cortana #winphan #winphans you just need a cat to call ""hellcat"" would be selling more if ms would put it through standard disti channels for the sme buyers any idea when we will see them down under? went to 4 ms stores in us and none had stock pathetic response from #nbnco why stop tpg from offering this great solution. move the goalposts much nbnco ? pack of morons try a lumia 930. great phone and os. i have converted many droid and iphone fans #windowsphone put details in the facebook site, but will not hold my breath your billing and dispute process is pathetic. why should the customer keep chasing you up over your faults? #poorserivce please stop the constant isis coverage. it is getting beyond a joke. every 10mins is enough. my kids are watching these asian countries are tiny. fibre to the home in australia is way to costly ##nbn it is a great app. easier to use than the ipad app. thank you icetv for supporting wp8 and giving us this great app. i have a 2014   srt and would like to know how we can request feature requests to uconnect ? # srt just shows you that great thing happen to great people. well done dan, you are a great guy #f1 #f1australia can you please rt a fundraiser for owner scott's son we have just lost power in forestville, looks like most of the suburb. any ideas? can i please ask you one question. will we see an 2017   srt? # srt will you send one to a tf and tg fan from australia ? as a lib supporter, i cannot see why you need to fix all the problems in one year. go easy, and set direction i hope not, as the kids have claimed the old one it has been reported, but getting told 12 days to fix a fault is not acceptable. i would be out of business if i did the same they said it was outside of my home cabling. this is frenchs forest exchange in sydney. it was fine at 8am today. big thanks to vf. ordered a new ipad air 128gb last friday, told 4-6 weeks delivery, arrived today. great work. why does think that 2 weeks to repair a pstn fault is acceptable? this is unacceptable and i am not happy looks like it was hit with the ugly stick #nissanjuke how can i order a   srt in australia without a cd player? i am glad that someone in the media can see the truth and make it public. is there any way i can order a srt   in australia without the cd player in the center console? # srtau any news on the 1520? really would like one from vf your not wrong, sony notebooks are great looking rubbish. most unreliable pc on the market. lenovo should walk away, quickly so the guy is a idiot and a murderer. i hope he gets life. scum we have lost power in forestville nsw, any idea when it will be back? yeah, got it and the update was faultless. mine is a vf au supplied 925 my vf lumia 925 updated this morning. so far so good #windowsblack was it buy one get an rt free? #mssurface happy birthday mate #nyebday great night to watch the 6'ers smash up the stars #smashemsixers good thing about your work ben, is that now the world know what scum tim sabre really is. it is far better to get them printed professionally from places like harvey norman. consumables are expensive the ""new improved"" chicken kiev you are now selling in sydney is appalling. processed chicken and crap crumbs. will not buy again. it would be las vegas, as lumia means ""art from light"", it is colourful and beautiful at night #lumialuckydip i would love to watch iview, but i have a windows phone,when will you fix this? #ourabctoo #wp8au hi, i just realised that my lumia 925 does not have datasence, yet an unbranded 925 does have it on vf. when can i get it ? the rfs website is down #sydneyfires i think that neil armstrong, astronaut, could take some impressive pictures from the moon of our planet #lumialuckydip thanks for that, you should update that website to ensure people know it for the future. hi, i was asked to email you and sent this link: problem is, there is no email address to send it to #toydefense great game peppa pig italiano - l'asilo #lumia quadrocopter for the best aerial shots from above #lumialuckydip how about an extreme case to protect my #lumia1020 when skydiving or mountain biking #lumialuckydip how about a extreme case to mount to my helmet when i am skydiving? #lumia1020 waterproof camera case, so i can take it scuba diving and make a call from the bottom of the ocean #lumia1020 i would love the camera grip. gives me the best phone and best camera in one neat package #lumia1020 i use au weather pro and it is great most people just install windows8 on their air to make it better mate, sorry to see you depart 10, i really enjoyed your ""truth is"" and late nigh news. #10news has lost a great jurno peppa pig espanol 4 - la capsula del tiempo 1/2 the road taken up by a green line reserved for the 10 bike riders that would use it? i got 14805 points while escaping from a giant demon monkey. beat that! just looks like a lumia925 that does not help me. none of the stores in your list have any 925 covers and the one i found would not fit with the shell i need a flip case for my #lumia925 with the wifi charging shell. cannot find any that fit, any suggestions? if i had a choice between canberra or kirribilli, i would take the waterfront calling you what ? i hear them calling you all sorts of things on #tgusa that could make a mean ratrod, if you strip it back old school the good old nokia 2110, it is from the 1990's. accidentally dropped in the water after a week, got another after that remember this how come you guys have hidden the internet filter until the last minute? i was a supporter of yours until i found this out been really happy with my #lumia925 it is the best phone i have ever used. selling my s3 now as i won't be going back all these nay sayers have nfi when it comes to technology. fibre will be obsolete in the future one day thanks for that, i bought the ipad version and find it very handy. now my #lumia925 can have the same functions. the node nbn plan is very workable. fibre to the node can be upgraded to fibre to the house when it is needed. no gold plating i missed speaking to you on i thought you came across really well and got people to better understand node nbn thanks for the heads up, i downloaded it to watch this weekend. think i will just let the kids watch it nice my mate just ordered the same colour in the redline model. has to wait 3months for it. nice car btw got all my cans of coke taken at the gate because of security, yet i can by cans from inside the stadium #rulessuck then is is just a plane ssv vf commadore i would say a holden vf ssv redline one of my staff is a wp nut and very up with ms software. he does not have a ticket , but his gf does. i am sure the wet'n'wild water park opening has nothing to do with it. there is a hidden agenda there. i signed for 24 months in april '13, on the 10 user corp infinity plan. pity it does nothing for existing customers on vf 24 month cotnracts. why do i find out today that i cannot get the $5 roaming on my vf corporate account ? no fair option on a 24 month contract the alp's nbn is so pathetic. deliver high speed porn to the boonies and nothing to where it is needed i would suggest you find a recommended building inspector. they will find things you will never notice. look sir, eggs! #angrybirdsstarwars no more training do you require. already know you, that which you need. #angrybirdsstarwars also with the way the nbn is designed, it also will have congestion. the poi will always be the bottleneck if you build a meshed network designed for data, not phones, you will get a better result. just remember moors law how was your mobile data 3years ago? alot changes in a few years. if the nbn blows out in cost to $90+billion dollars we will not be paying it off in our lifetime. wireless is the future. because he does not want our grankids paying for it, as it is a gold plated solution and does not solve any problems well done mate. i just got it for my #lumia925. great app i will be watching the tonight and not a bunch of polies bs'ing #gruen i do not need to get it from your site, my account rep ordered me one this morning. i hope to get it in a couple of days. you might want to update your windows phone page, as the 925 is still not listed. also there is no outright buy opt something is wrong with your online store. i have tried twice to process my order and it fails when i ""place order"" hi mate, do you have the blue 820 wireless and red 925 wireless charging shells in stock ? just got a call from my vf account manager that the #lumia925 is released today for order. #wp8au the media is too hyped up on gig speed and ftth to see what the long term cost is. any updates on the #lumia925 ? being it was meant to be released mid to late august #impatient loved your interview on #sn7 . i have had the sleeve op as well and lost 25kg for the same reasons as you. if you keep spending like there is no limit, will cause us more problems in the long term #alpnfi how come we cannot get patties gluten free sausage rolls anymore? our school has had to take off the menu #glutenfree will that mean we do not see immediate announcements by twitter ? seems like a grab for personal info to me. you should use the hokey pokey ad for next weeks advertising. very creative and point how can the liberals submit a plan when the alp's is such a disaster. #nbnmess i would have no faith in kpmg ability to cost anything. their trails of fraud and errors is long and regular. that is not correct, the 820 is not 4g until it gets the firmware that has been delayed 2 months due to bugs. do i have to use a #lumia925 to take the pic ? i only have my #lumia820 as i am waiting for vf to get the 925 in. #lumiamoon yes, please show me how i can do it on my lumia 820 thanks guys for taking my call. love the show, keep it up. how do your views on #ausvotes compare with those of the major parties? find out with #votecompass: the problem with speeds and the nbn is most people think they need gig, what they need is consistent speed shot with my lumia 820 in the backyard #lumiamoon just hurry up with the 925, i want one now!!! pity you are not behind the windows phone. while it may be late tot he party, it is a better os for phones. any update on when we can order the nokia lumia 925, i am getting really impatient. #lumia925 only edit one note, never office docs. i have a tablet and pc for that. might be your mate from publicity monster, he is known to buy followers i know, bit i can't get 4g on my 820 and i can't buy a 925 from you. my ipad is the only thing enjoying your 4g. i would love too, but vodafone have not got any yet. #want925 i am sure #krudd is making our country get to the magic 0% interest rate, he has nfi what economics is i am glad i am a #wpuser on the #vodafoneau network. i just wished they would rollout 4g on the 820 do you support the public safety 4g network ? seems like a good long term plan to provide spectrum, while it is available. i would like oremote to make one as it works with many makers. the ipad version is great. need win8 very now. rt the choice is clear. rt if you support the coalition #auspol it made me laugh, because it is most likely close to the truth. with the speeds being seen on wifi, the ftth model of the nbn is a massive waste of money. #nbnjoke they were dumb not to continue to use holden as the brand. trying to market opel in oz was just plain dumb i love race sims, but it needs a real cockpit with controller, not some console hand controller. pity we cannot twitter the 3rd umpire and tell him what we think. #sponsoredbyspecsavers when can i order the lumia 925? i need to get one asap and my vf tech fund is busting to be spent. it is a joke. vodafone said my 820 is 4g. wasted a heap of time making it not work. well done hamilton, you prick webber will be kicking butt now webber = most unluckiest guy in f1 senna i have already contacted my accmgr to pre book mine. #wp8 #vodafoneftw i would love to attend. i bet it is either the nokia 1020 or 925 launch. or both. take my money now yes, wp is by far the best mobile phone os and needs support from the abc just having them announce it is good enough for me. lets hope it is soon. that is the best news i have heard all day. when we can order it ? #vodafoneftw wow my ipad is faster on 4g than adsl2- download 45.46 mbps - upload 9.01 mbps - ping 233ms #vodafone4g with the massive amount they paid for the rights, there is nothing left for the commentary team. i hear billy birmingham is ready all sorted out, thanks for the help email sent to i did not believe what they were saying. first called logged at 1pm then again at 9pm no eta for fix. the phone looks fine. calls go straight to vm. can divert to my phone. your support says it is a nsw network prob. can make calls and sms. can send and receive data. no receiving calls or sms. my phone is also vf and is fine. i would be wearing my #manofsteel costume purchased with my ebay app on my #lumia920 #nokiapowerau my wife cannot receive calls on her mobile in sydney. vf support say random people have this prob. true? being the pro reporter she is, there would be linkedin, twitter, facebook, photobeamer, cnn and nokia music #nokiapowerau my 820 does not have 4g listed under network, only 2g &amp; 3g. the problem looks to be my mobile as one of my staff with a nokia 920 has 4g and we a all on the same biz infinite. we are a corporate plan and have already checked that we are ready to go. i have a vf nokia lumia 820 and i am in a 4g area. why do i not get 4g?

"lol. carmen you kill me. so killer. i think the recoding is so good. for the first time ever i can say the recorded version of a song blew me away more than the live wow carmen. is never thought i'd hear you say that. of you could thatd be cool if not i can wait till midnight. they are such a tease. oh. damn. is the damn thing on itunes yet? cool we will be in baltimore i'm actually surprised he answered that one. omg. that's the funniest thing ever. who's lady and who's the tramp lol ha thanks. the grossest job i've ever had was working with human placentas. poor lzzy when she reads this lol i am a genetic engineer. i make new cartilage for patients knees out of their own cells. it's pretty cool. yuck. i'd rather cut up knee joints thank you. cutting up body parts today😷 my job is cooler than yours... not. have a great show tonight. listening to your version of girl crush again. halestorm and little big town should do a vh1 crossroads. i think it would be killr #mcm totally goes to for letting me cross items off my bucket list. yeah good luck. i hope it's not as weird as it seems. frankly it seems a little possessive on his part if it's not a joke i hope so too. ok extra weird just awkward lol 😕 i spent 6 days talking to him and he helped us out a lot. who knows. are you looking forward to all of the festival dates mixed in with the com tour? i'm not sure about it especially since his reply to me saying things are better left unsaid. maybe he didn't realize she was doing a q and a about the album. i don't know i know lzzy doesn't feel like that and i find it a little off because lzzy would never say something like that. she welcomes them and answers what she wants to i don't think so. no clue what he means especially since lzzy started the convo to talk about the record. sorry you got sick. kelly came back with the flu. glad everyone is getting better hope you're feeling better btw. thanks agreed. i know i act 12 38 it's really awkward hearing her talk about orgasms lol. i'm old enough to be her mom. i still might for fun not sure sometime early afternoon i would think. #soon lol. 💔 #taken lol oh why do you do this ? to kill us? from sweden. yep. horrible. i dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste lol yep. and frankly mind is dirty too and she will be 18 so i can no longer go to jail for hearing her mind carter you talking to the wrong group of freaks for that. some of us need to know everything 😁😳 lol. smash that bitch lol no i am lol. kelly says i'm a dirty old man. i'm ok with having a dirty mind lol she provoked the ass smacking of the guys though. josh is married so i wouldn't do that 😁 i don't have a halo after that trip not exactly a fear. more respect since she is a woman. i don't want to be like a perverted guy. hey lzzy can i smack your ass lol it's ok with him since there's no real attraction it was just fun lol. i'd rather die then ask to smack lzzys ass. 😁 #mortified and i'm the gay one lol. at least i smacked joes ass and pet him while i was drunk she didn't want to get in trouble and i said it was ok i had a hall pass for her lol... things you shouldn't say sober lol we will get the evidence. when i got the kiss pic with lzzy, kelly wasn't near me and lzzy was like where is your wife lol 😳😁😍 i love that they will do any crazy shit we ask. our friend was like do you think they'd do duck lips. the answer was yes lol and i understand the withdrawal that comes at the end. i hope they make it back to you guys soon perfectly said. there's just something about the whole experience. i think this says it all #twoweeks can't wait joe had said in the uk that no one will have ever heard you like this before. he said your vocals are incredible😉 two words #coreytaylor #intothewildlife since you say the album is a story do you think you'll ever play it front to back live? #intothewildife what inspired what sober couldn't say? true story. incredible balance. every time. it never fails. i can't wait to listen to it on vinyl for a true classic rock experience. ha that would be the only way i could wear heels lol. i am horrible at being a girl. i'd break an ankle. i was so hoping that you would do this. i love it. i'm pretty sure you can sing anything. awesome job. 😳 &amp; the guys are great too i heard said you'll be in the octane studio. that's exciting. it's give and take marine. i hear they will be back your way later in the year. i know you guys are having fun over there but i can't wait until you're back in the states. nashville is so soon. can't wait. nice choice for milan. that's all😁 they opened for sugarland a few years ago. they were really fun. i've had the album for awhile before the song was controversial. i've seen little big town in the front row. great live band cool. that's awesome.the recorded sound came out really good. love both versions did you see covered #girlcrush killed it. glad to see you being more positive😀 i am the fire will kick your ass. lucky enough

think that about sums it up. i am off friday also and we are hosting easter dinner for kelly's family. it should be a nice weekend lzzy always says that she gives so much of herself to us that her relationship is the one thing she will keep quiet i'm so over it lol hopefully we will all have a better week next week i don't know ask her. i know she has a so. she doesn't talk about it because it's her to keep to herself. 😁😳😝 ha. life is a funny thing. i'm just going with whatever is coming my way. good or bad. #liveforthemoment yes, so i can deal with the tooth pain. it can be solved just

that rock is definitely not dead. look who appeared in twitter world someday these issues will go away but it may not be for a long time i get it but it's a fight i'm not going to win. there is no separation of church and state. laws based on religion i frankly can't waste my energy fighting ignorant religious radicals. i still eat chikfila if i boycotted every business that did not agree with my marriage i might as well not leave the house. religious freedom. no skin off my back. if i know a place doesn't want my business i won't go. no need to cause issues i think arkansas also wow looks

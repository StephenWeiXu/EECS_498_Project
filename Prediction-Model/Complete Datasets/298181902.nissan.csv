"that’s at intercontinental. i’m flying out of hobby. rt no. 1 aggies host sam houston state tuesday evening i thought my layover was in dallas and was going to bring y’all whataburger, but i was wrong... get out of my brain okay now that i have eaten my weight in roast beef and curly fries, i think it's time for a pint or ten of vermont's finest... then i question your commitment tbh and you have a bojangles so we can call it even go to maryland idk thanks bae you always give the best advice i am a huge fan, but that is just.... no. arby's now has gyros? nope. 😳😳😳 every day gets easier. (i think. i know nothing about having children.) relevant... when people put a period in 'dr pepper' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; i think your taste buds are broken. ummmmmmm no. not at all. i have everything at home to make stroganoff tonight, but has me craving arby's instead... come on... you're supposed to leave this kind of stuff for ... there is literally no difference between east texas and southern arkansas minus the whole political boundaries thing... this was in arkansas. but yes. i was drinking coffee by the time i was 5, and i was drinking it black by middle school. i blame my grandmother. rt the usa today poll makes it official: texas a&amp;m — your new no. 1 team in the nation. rt well would ya look at that... your fightin' texas aggies are #1 in the nation. oh hi hello yes well there is a town called college station that would love to embrace his bbq without rules. arkansas? or east texas? i feel like both are equally not good... yes. sorry :( my involved? yeah. that's the one i was talking about. i like this. mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy... 🎶 i feel like there's not really a correct way to answer this questions... oh my god i mean of course i know what 8 inches looks like... tbh i wasn't sure what eight inches looked like. i was thinking maybe law school hair? hate u rn oooooooh that could be fun. whatttt? like today? okay just keep telling yourself that buddy that's funny. houston is not lexington, kentucky... whattttttt. you didn't tell me they were coming to texas! or how about we just treat people like people? okay sounds good. ready? break. those who are religious will always hide behind their beliefs for some sort of discrimination. you can't just draw a line. that was my thought on the issue. what makes these laws any different that the racial discrimination laws? happy birthday to you, i just saw the beer trappe. looks like there are a couple bars around that corner. pr people for fraternities are working extra hard this month, i see... lexington only. we are going for baseball. i think we're going to a distillery in frankfort, too. i mean it's got 300,000 people. it's a lot bigger of a college town than i am used to. cs only has 100,000. who has been to lexington, kentucky? any restaurants/bars that should not be missed? people, man... dbu should have been ranked for a few weeks now. they're one of the best programs in the state! lol agreed. on pace to definitely host a regional, and as of right now, i really like our chances for a nat seed. i just saw perfect game. what the actual fuck... erroneous just read all the fine print. it's like spirit airlines. know exactly what you're doing, and you'll be fine. rt i’m on record as saying rankings in college baseball are dumb.. but goodness, 22-6 vanderbilt over 27-2 a&amp;m… they're definitely dumb. they don't matter. but that elusive #1 is nice when your team truly deserves that spot. ryanair? and germanwings does some cool cheap blind bookings. i'm more annoyed with rice. they haven't done anything this year except splitting a 4 game series against texas first weekend. and an 11-loss rice team still being #14 is an absolute joke. kendall rogers and aaron fitt are the best in the business, but come on. having a 6-loss vanderbilt team ranked #1 over a 2-loss a&amp;m team is just stupid. rt craziest stat of the week -- by far -- slugged 12 homers in a 34-10 win over ut-martin. 15 total hit … those pants are fun! we could sell the videos and get rich. some people are probably into that shit, and who am i to judge? rude i just remembered this is only a three day work week... again... #allofthetravels but you get to see me this week so be excited i'd shove that roast beef and cheddah so far down my throat right now omg uoeno hahahahahahahahaha this is too good. welcome back! go to bed i was just going to let him have his moment. i like the way you work it 😏 one of my favorite weekends of all time. seriously. 👍 okay but the food makes it worth it... i volunteer as tribute the sun has taken so much out of me the past two days. i think it's bedtime. truuuuu. much classier... needs arby's sauce, tbh... just saw a car with both lsu and a&amp;m stickers on it, and i kind of want to vomit now. ughhhh same and now im sitting in standstill traffic on a sunday because houston is terrible. and the original tweet was when i was stopped at a gas station... 😁 you're fine. it's your job. texas is surprisingly one of the few states that doesn't have cell phone laws. i endorse this so hard. i enjoyed it. rt #vanderbilt finishes of rival #tennessee with a 14-3 win this afternoon. good chance either the dores or aggies are no… this wind is killing my gas mileage. not totally sure yet. i'm going to try, but i'm leaving early on wednesday, so if i have a lot to do, i can't. do i really have to go back to houston now? 😔 that story is just horrifying from beginning to end. 😳😳😳😳😳😳 ja rt wangs is for winners #whammy was asking for it... there's a joke in there somewhere... #thuglyfe watching this kid play the shooting game in the arcade at wings 'n more is 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. rt huge series win once again! the #12thman was big time this weekend! not a better environment to play in. #aggiebaseball rt put whammys into orbit today for the huge series win. stay safe college stati… 😔😔😔 you know i love you wangs you're equally insufferable in both but i love you and we are stuck with you so 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 if we can come away from lexington this week with a series win, i'll feel very good with state and arky coming to town the following weeks. you are missing cher! rt no. 3 texas a&amp;m defeats missouri 14-6, wins series rt huge shout out to the #12thman this weekend as broke the blue bell park series attendance record with 18,776! #cherthewin ags win! 27-2! #aggiebaseball i ain't made for all that. let's use the term 'fan' very loosely... don't call me that. gross. no it is 85 degrees, and i am going to be so sunburned. yessir! #203ontheroad you mean ryan travels to lexington this weekend” rt beating lsu in baseball? rt hey uk. there’s only one reason you’re still in this conference. do your damn… uk takes the series from lsu in baton rouge this weekend. #aggiebaseball travels to lexington later this week. with lsu's loss, it is very likely that texas aggie baseball will be #1 in the nation tomorrow. rt #shadesonsixth was definitely the inning of the #rallyshark and it was beautiful. and we now have #emftx on the mound with brigham hill coming in to pitch for the aggies. preach🙌🙌🙌 rt currently #aggiebaseball has 9 runs in the 6th absolutely. and fuck auburn. those three things should be universal. rt note: texas a&amp;m hit 25 home runs all last year in 60-plus games. the ags already have 26 homers in 29 games this season. #new… yassssssssss kentucky logan taylor grand slam boomstick! #whammy #whammy #whammy #whammy rt this is exactly how a good team bounces back after a tough loss. #aggiebaseball in total control, up 7-0 b6. i love this… rt nebraska defeats no. 16 texas 6-2, sweeps series oh hai rt #aggiebaseball 18,776 for weekend series. best ever at blue bell. fifth best at olsen rt a&amp;m/mizzou on one. lsu/kentucky on the other. screw both tigers. rt texas and nebraska have combined for 17 hits through 5 innings today. unfortunately nebraska has 15 of them and leads 6-0. boomstick mitchell nau! #whammy it's been really fun to watch him progress since freshman year, and i really like him on sun. better then everyone's sun guy. so happy that #theonewithsoul is back in and bringing his dance moves. rt how good is pitching this weekend? #texas has one run in 25 innings so far. #huskers cruising 6-0, … boomstick logan nottebrok! #whammy #whammy #letsgetnotte rt yes unfortunately, he's nowhere near the only one willing to make that mistake. gbh. not even close. rt a new record... #wheresmysundial rt i just heard literally the slowest national anthem i have ever heard in my life. how. why. #aggiebaseball that national anthem was more than three minutes. i am not joking. dixieland delight #notrickhits dixieland delight #rickhits mayyyyyyybe it was southern summer nights dogs are great! not good for the seats, but at least in the berms... i hate people so much. i'm glad that people are starting to support more, but i could do without the uninformed opinions... 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌 yaasssss i'll have a friend! quite a wind blowing out today here at olsen. i'm not saying... i'm just saying... #whammy what time are you getting there? false. so so wrong. brunch at blackwater is bae. absolutely not. my stomach isn't strong enough for that anymore. am currently wondering why we did not go to brunch this morning... lrt: i wish we allowed dogs into our ga sections. the only dog allowed in olsen field right now is daphne. rt as a reminder, all dogs must be in general admission sections this is v poetic bruh unless we totally implode, we're hosting a regional with a decent shot at a national seed. i just can't be upset. i know. you couldn't and wouldn't hurt a fly. fuck yes panini press that is a goldmine. i demand custody of that one. okay ill meet you in 20 we can kick some ass i know. and mizzou sucks. they're so bad. wait... they're ranked and were tied with us for first place? oh. too many stupid people. and baseball is a totally different animal from other sports. we're going to drop more games. okay but i get the magic bullet i don't either. i was just reading. and bicycle crasher. my favorite quote... 'pretty underwhelming. thought we were better.' lololololokaybye reading texags is fun. lots of bandwagoners who know nothing about college baseball. by fun, i mean it makes me want to punch some morons. the beauty of baseball: another day, another game. we've got a series to win! #bthomizzou i wouldn't even wish that on my own worst enemy. (i keed i keed. i quit after undergrad.) ohhhh. we're still doing that thing where we pretend a jd is a real doctorate... 😂 i can usually make out danish when reading it. kind of. but think... just a three day work week! i have not spilled anything all year i am so excited baking soda the state flag at the arkansas capitol is just as high... about the flag. any state flag can be flown as high. other states just don't care enough to buy two poles. not true. that is an urban legend. minus the whole losing the game thing, today was everything. go astros. i honestly don't think i can think of a legitimate reason... because i hate them. i don't think i've ever met a person down here that doesn't hate them. the south. i hate uk, but i will never root for notre dame. ever. people keep saying that america was rooting for notre dame, but i know way more people that were rooting for kentucky. way more. bruh his feet were moving rt you would be amazed how much of #sectwitter is watching baseball/softball or whatever roll damn cats rt on a big screen under the trees with a bunch of friends is the best way to watch the ncaa tournament. rt somewhere, president bartlett is having a heart attack. #notredame #marchmadness this is actually the first game of the tournament i've watched... i mean i don't like kentucky... but i hate notre dame. jester king is so bae... - drinking an atrial rubicite by edelweiss gartens playground — okay but erik if he hadn't gotten hurt... drinking a wisconsin belgian red by wellborn. tx — yes. drinking a citra single hop pale ale by oil derrick — thatd be too questionable i can move back to this town now, or? rt 😍😍😍😍😍 "

had enough of this weather, going somewhere next weekend for a few days. options being: somewhere in florida, scottsdale, or palm springs have we heard from yet about the ole' 49ers little cheating scandal yet? that makes the ethical and humble, non-murdering patriots the undisputed greatest team in the history of all teams ever times infinity. all the 49ers super bowls tainted and will be rescinded by the nfl after jerry rice admits to horrendous cheating: tell her elsa from frozen eats it you just say it's ""good"" or wicked pissa as we'd say in boston i cringe and die a little bit inside whenever i hear a man say the word ""yummy."" unacceptable term for a grown ass man to use. #fb v lookups are the best thing ever in excel great audio and video of the superbowl, both teams, coaches, and gameplay: 1st half: second: rt press release: belichick to be on letterman next wednesday. tom hanks, too boston sports are destroying ny's, and it's not even close, via i actually like it, though those feelings were developed as a child we need waterworld 2 kevin costner is bustin' out cheesy disney movies like every other month now hmmm, maybe who the hell is this chick?

they ruined this with missy eliot. this is unnecessary. this hasn't been terrible #halftime whoop whoop! #patriots #superbowlxlix are you kidding me? they're having john harbaugh on at halftime? he shouldn't be anywhere near any nfl event right now. and now the internet will explode after walter white appears #breakingbad gotta ru8n it there tommy, plenty of room no idea what happened in that nissan commercial remember, it should be 14-0 right now...this has been a one-sided affair thus far whoever had the big prop bet that lafell would get the first td just made a lot of money #superbowlxlix ahhh, never even put that together they were the same person really? i've seen them all so far and i never even noticed why does lenny kravitz still get major roles in events like this? who's even heard lenny kravitz since like the mid 90's? i think that carnival/jfk commercial was trying too hard to be like the dodge ""god made a farmer"" paul harvey ad a few years ago #superbowl i'll never use t-mobile for anything hey now! in all their superbowls since 2001, the #patriots have never scored a td in the first quarter, believe it or not. #superbowlxlix blount mode #patriots the more i see of kate upton the less attractive she gets patriots seem ferocious right now belichick was wearing a ""don't tread on me"" t-shirt before the game. pete carroll is a 9/11 truther. #patriots #seagulls #superbowlxlix i thought gronk was going to throw that... #patriots rt los angeles, ladies and gentlemen rt bill belichick electing to go with the full-sleeved hoodie #sb49 it must be an honor for #seahawks players and fans to even get to share such an experience with the #patriots. they must be in awe. going to lose years off my life tonight due to stress. biggest, most important super bowl ever played... #patriots #seagulls #superbowlxlix apologies to come from across league now as nfl themselves reporting #patriots balls ""only a few ticks"" below minimum ugh, once again i didn't win powerball last night. i deserve a refund, i've played like 50 times in life and never once won the jackpot. ugh "

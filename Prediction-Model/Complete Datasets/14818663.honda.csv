i enoyed #insurgent, but it didn't seem to track much to the book. the ending was good. #insurgentatregal she gives it a thumbs up though if you eat at a conveyor belt sushi place and don't stack your plates by color, we could never be friends. got my #eccc mobile app ( ) my car and driveway are covered in pretty pink cherry blossom petals. happy birthday, twitter! oh: ""i'm glad i saved when i was young."" #boomer yes, decided to skip that generation. something new will be along soon. i do have tons of dvds. i watch them all the time. no blu-ray though. i probably won't do that. not a fan of adding to digital files or cloud. i have lots of movies i watch maybe once a year. seems not worth buying dvd replacement. you can do that at costco, i think. i have a duo vcr/dvd player still. i'm finding it very hard to let go and throw out all my vhs movies. time to do it. it's not really cutting the cord if you replace cable with bunch of expensive subscriptions. those services won't survive w/o low fees. are we there yet?

now people will spend more to have it delivered?! i'm rising, but not shining. well, no parking, no customers. good luck! it's bad enough the other merchants put up no parking signs too. there's very little parking in front of your restaurant, why do you park your own car in a spot customers could use? my friends all have more fun than i do. i'm doing it wrong. thankful today for dental insurance &amp; my new temp crown for my broken tooth. rt i know it's not rational, but i'm really upset with someone on the east coast for posting a walking dead spoiler w/photo s… swipe, delete. my favorite thing to do on my iphone. people like to compare things and declare a winner. rarely is it one winner and other a loser. still sick but better. thinking pizza will help. i love them! childhood family vacations in ga &amp; fl. i'm sure you will get offers. i looked at your pics. very nice! it's fun to see inside people's homes. i'll probably never move. maybe i'll buy another url today that i might use someday, in observance of #30yearsofcom. realized i've already seen homeland s3 and not in the mood for downton abbey. think i'll watch #darkangel from the beginning. put a litlle love in your sausage #replaceasongtitlewithsausage i didn't even go to wine club today. stupid cold. i think she's competitive! i have an old   so i'm always curious to see this headline. people knock on my door all the time wanting to buy it. this isn't new for  s. it's hard to believe the market for old   parts is so big, unless they are being shipped out. pie is good. i have it maybe 3.14 times a year. last week it was the dress. today, it's pi. soon the interwebs will move on. must go to costco and run errands. this being sick on weekends can suck it. that's so sweet! seems like many tweets pitching sponsors at #sxsw. not much disclosure. this is written so well. rt: how to survive the college admissions madness: kite surfing when all of a sudden, a whale! photograph by michael swaine #photo wow you'd be standing first, i say. always if you only fall seven times, why do you have to get up eight?
